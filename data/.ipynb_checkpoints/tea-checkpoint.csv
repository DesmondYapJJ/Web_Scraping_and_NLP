3,tea,"I noticed that pretty much everybody selling Colombian black tea sells some combination of four options: tippy black, leafy black, wiry black, and chocolate kisses. This suggests a single wholesaler or grower as the source of pretty much all Colombian black tea I see for sale.

I finally did some googling around and found [this article](https://www.killgreen.io/main/history-tea-colombia), which suggests that most orthodox tea in Colombia is produced under the brand Bitaco Unique; which is a subsidiary of Colombia's own CTC producer: Hindu.

I found the site for Hindu and then Bitaco Unique, and [they sell tippy black and chocolate kisses tea](https://bitacotea.com/linea-a-granel/), so that's one mystery solved. They also sell an oolong I have never seen for sale before although when I try to buy it I get an error page, so I'm guessing they stopped making it but forgot to remove it. And so if the page is out of date, it might also not reflect a new distinction between leafy and wiry black.

So I kept googling and I found [this article](https://www.killgreen.io/main/colombian-specialty-tea) from the same blog as I had found earlier, which specifies that these three kinds of black tea are sorted into grades after they have been fully processed.  And now I'm scratching my head. The ""tippy black"" seems to be essentially a broken grade, and so it makes sense that that would produce a stronger, more astringent tea. 

But I can't figure out why the leafy and wiry black would turn out so differently, because I am absolutely convinced that the wiry black tastes a lot better, with fruity notes I do not get in the leafy black. I'm wondering now if that's all in my head, maybe because it looks more like higher quality Chinese teas I am used to and I'm just expecting it to be better?","I was curious about the story on Colombian black tea and found some answers, although now I'm a bit confused on the differences between leafy and wiry black"

10,tea,"I have been drinking tea since a young age and once I hit the age of around 12/13 I have felt almost addicted to black tea. For about 8 years straight I would drink on average around 5-7 big mugs of tea every day. The first thing I did in the morning and last did thing before bed is have a big ol cuppa. One evening when I was 21 or22 I started getting an itch in my ear that rapidly grew in intensity and stared spreading to other parts of my body in the coming weeks. It got to the point where i couldn’t sleep properly and went to multiple doctors to no avail. The itchy parts of my body don’t show any sign of skin conditions and although prescribed creams did work when I was using them daily, the itches always came back after the treatment period. Using strong steroid based creams for long periods is not something I want to do. So I started cutting things out of my diet to see if it helped. Surely enough my itches are mostly gone since I’ve given up tea. Two years later I still get a couple days of itching and disturbed sleep when I drink a cup of tea. I’ve also noticed that on the rare occasions I have tea nowadays, it fucks with my brain a lot and makes me very nervous and anxious. Coffee does not trigger the itches or mental effects.

I'm particularly interested in Taiwan and HK, where I do most of my tea buying.

Some stores are eager to brew a few different teas and let you sample and talk about tea for seemingly a long time. Some stores don't offer, and it feels uncomfortable to ask (I have before, though, and it usually is fine).

I have a few questions for people who know the scene well, and am open to suggestions of any kind!

1. If you sample (particularly drinking many paos of different teas), is there an expectation of purchasing? And how much (assume it has something to do with what you sample, too)?
2. Is it weird to ask to sample tea?

23,tea,"Hi! I'm a long time tea lover, but my proper training is actually in coffee. I've found that among the coffee folks, it's currently very popular to be hyper scientific with your brew. Extraction times, temperatures, ratios. Everything is carefully and highly controlled to an almost silly level of specificity and repeatability. 

I find in the tea world this isn't always the case. Often we get measurements like ""two teaspoons of tea to 8oz of water."" And ranges like ""80-95c"" or ""2-5 minutes"". Instructions are usually something along the lines of: ""brew longer or hotter if you like your tea stronger."" But stronger doesn't exactly mean anything specific, at least when it comes to the tasting notes and flavor of the tea in the cup. 

I've searched high and low for guides with specific details on how to adjust tea to taste, but often it's all just as vague. 

In coffee, I have very specific parameters I'm in control of. And I control them for very specific reasons. For a bolder, more present flavor, I can use more coffee in the recipe. For a brighter, more sour taste, I can shorten my extraction time, and for darker, more bitter, I can increase it. In order to extract more compounds from a bean, I can raise the temperature, or lower it to extract less. 

So I'd like to discuss doing the same with tea, if possible. 

-If I change my steep temperature hotter or cooler, what specific flavor change can I expect?

-if I increase or decrease my steep time, what specific flavors am I likely to bring out or avoid?

-by dosing more or less tea but keeping the amount of water the same, is the only change going to be a more or less present overall flavor?

Often I see posts asking what's the ""right"" temperature and time for a certain tea. But I want to focus on how to get the ""right"" flavor for you, with that specific tea, in that specific moment. 

Thank you in advance!",Adjusting Parameters by Taste
24,tea,"***\*Mods, this is about non-THC, CBD oil, which is 100% legal in Colorado!\****

I just opened up a tea shop in downtown Denver (been open 3 months now). There's a CBD oil salesman that keeps coming into the shop at least a couple times a week trying to sell me and my staff on adding this ""CBD-infuser"" machine. It would basically allow us to charge $2-3 extra per drink if someone wanted a tea with ""CBD oil."" I'm inclined to tell him we're not interested, but I wanted to see if anyone in this group has had experience with CBD-infused tea before. My mind is still open, and I could be persuaded to try it out.

Here's some more things I'm considering:

* No customer has ever specifically asked for ""CBD oil"" in their tea drink. I.e., there's no clear demand for it. 
* I don't know enough about CBD oil to determine whether it truly does have demonstrable and scientifically-backed health benefits, like the camellia sinensis leaf does. 
* I'm concerned that if I offer CBD oil in the store, it's going to taint my shop. My café is a peaceful oasis from the outside world, and I want to keep it that way, focusing on the peace and tranquility that tea (and pastries and other goodies) brings to my customers. 
* We get a lot of out-of-state tourists, so maybe the CBD-oil thing would pique their interest?

52,tea,"Hey all,

I'm a long time user of this subreddiit, and a big proponent of tea. I've always been drinking tea, and other beverages, usually caffeinated. Tea has always held a special place in my heart, and something I'm passionate about as our many of you here. I grew up on basic Lipton tea, and assorted store bought teas premade. Spending time with my Aunt, I got to try a variety of flavors, those memories of sleepy time mint, haha. I eventually met others through work who introduced me to other teas, green, herbal, pu'er, yerba mate, matcha, the list goes on and on. I went on to loose leaf and never looked back. I have taken on many health problems since in my twenties, possibly even earlier. Tea allowed me to enjoy the simpler things in life, and relax, focus, and endure. Tea helped me make healthier choices. I won't lie I have been experimenting with drinks my whole life, so I have tried mixing teas with food, smoothies, and other drinks such as alcohol, and soda to name a few. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward, I've become a tea snob, much like many of you. I am joyed with the seasons and changing of tea flavors, winter is coming and I'm excited to break out my chai's, chestnut tea, and assorted holiday blends. When this pandemic hit, I stayed in the house and avoided most outdoor activities. Just me, my computer, and my tea. A year or two into the pandemic my health went to crap. I've had to completely adjust my diet to lose weight and account for my diabetes. Sadly, this limits my use of certain sweeteners, and baked goods that compliments tea so while it saddens me, once again tea was there for me. I have been on a diet of mainly vegetables, hummus, and chicken. I don't think I would have done well without tea, as it was the only thing food wise to look forward to, the joy of my day, and only real source of variety in my day when it came to my diet. I'm down 100lbs and more to go. I'm working on getting my health in order, It's still and uphill battle sadly. I been getting treated for wounds and unable to make content like I used to on Twitch and YouTube. I'm used to making video game content, but I've been thinking about trying to make some other content and interact with people, maybe get away from the desk. One of the things I thought about doing was a tea podcast or tea reviews. I wanted to ping the community and see if there was any interest and if so, what people would be looking or and if anyone else wanted to get involved. Possibly looking for others to discuss tea, or what type of content people would be interested in talking about such at the recent trend of tea and sprite. Hopefully, this reaches you all well., I don't plan on acting on any of this anytime soon, I may not even do it, this is more to see if there is an interest. I am not posting any links to my channels / socials as I'm not trying to promote. All the same if this is taken the wrong way or modes see an issue feel free to remove. Also, anyone else out there with diabetes, Say Hi!, maybe you can share some of the things you are having.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I love tea, looking to change things up and embrace the one thing holding me together tea. Hoping to start a discussion and poll everyone to see if they would be interested in tea reviews / discussion, both listening or joining in. I'm taking my life back with tea, and debating sharing that journey. Not sure I will act on any of this.

I gave up tea because I found my mental health worsening and I figured tea wasn't helping. A week later and I started to feel better and having less of it. I hadn't drunk tea for some time before this and found for about a month or two I was fine. But I figured that removing it wouldn't hurt and as said I found it helped. However, with the price of bills and trying to keep the heating off I'm getting cold, so thought I'd fill my stomach with hot fluids to keep me warm. I'm considering the idea of decaf, or a fruit tea. The issue I'm having is I can't find a pure low ingredient fruit tea that I can have. The ones I've seen have loads of other plants in them.

Gold one looks better, but am curious whether there’s a difference in the chemical composition that would make any difference over time. i.e extra metals leeching into the water with increased exposure to boiling water that may be less than ideal for health, etc.

167,tea,"Hey Guys. New to Matcha. I'm getting a grade called 'Grand Cru'. It's not high grade Cerimonial Grade, and it's not Culinary grade. That's what the Tea Vendor is selling it as, anyway.

I find that no matter how long I use my handheld milk frother, there's always those clumps of dust at the bottom. Almost as much as what I put in before whisking. 

Is this normal? I blast it for about 15 seconds in a whirl pool of swirling 155 degree water with my handheld Frother, and I get a nice dark green color with a decent  froth. But, at the end of the cup, there's what looks like about 50% of the now wet powder at the bottom.

I've considered several factors. I've heard that matcha can settle back on the bottom if you don't gulp it down immediately. I've also considered that maybe I should re-froth it half way through. I've also considered that DavidsTea is selling that cheap Chinese crap and calling it Japanese Grand Cru Matcha.

170,tea,"I recently discovered that Amazon has a whole bunch of ""handmade genuine Yixing Zisha teapots"" and variations in the $10-30 range. (Although you have a few especially unscrupulous sellers trying to pass off identical pots just south of the range of actual Yixing pottery.) 

Now *obviously* these are not handmade (which is a huge problem I noticed with Chinese Etsy sellers years ago, and with Chinese eBay sellers, who not only like to misuse ""handmade"" but also ""vintage"") and therefore wouldn't qualify as actual Yixing ware. 

On the other hand, they are mostly priced to reflect the fact that they are mass-produced Chinese products. And they are often quite attractive. I'm going to buy at least one just as a decoration. (It is also in a style that I have never seen for authentic Yixing pots, but I like it.)

But there are two things I am curious about with regards to these pots:

1. What are the chances that despite being mass produced they do in fact use clay from Yixing County or at least a similar kind of clay from surrounding areas of the Yangtze Delta? Given the price how much Chinese sellers on English sites lie about this stuff it wouldn't surprise me if it's actually recycled ceramic and not made from fresh clay at all, but I'm still curious whether it might be actually the same or similar clay as authentic Yixing pottery, although presumably a lower grade. As I understand it; a big part of the price for authentic Yixing pottery is the skills of the potters. And I've done enough pottery myself to know that supposedly the same kind of clay often has various grades with markedly different price points, based on how thin you intend to make the piece and how hot you intend to fire it.

2. Any idea if these are actually food safe? Given the fact that I mostly brew tea in a mug anyways, and I am planning on getting a nice Polish pottery pot and nice Turkish samovar for when I have company, I don't see myself using any of these Chinese Yixing knock-off pots for tea anyways. I'm just wondering if I potentially *could* or if this is going to be another case of problematically high lead content?","Two questions on Amazon's ridiculously cheap ""handmade Yixing genuine Zisha teapots"""

Sometimes grandpa style for green teas and sometimes western (but a bit more leaf/water) for indian black teas. Japanese teas are imo something moving between the borders, where I adjust the style from gongfu to western depending on my mood.

Obviously, gongfu didn't do it for every tea. Some green teas got another kind of result, often better, with grandpa style. While indian teas and Ceylon seem to be better from like 1-2g/100ml, even though they can sometimes be whole leaves. Now the question is, what brewing methods do in your experience manage to help the teas perform at their best? What teas certainly do get worse when gongfu-ing?

203,tea,"I am familiar with the flavour change, which varies according to each tea type, I find. My favourite at the moment is an aged white tea ball, and I'll often do up to 10 or more steeps from one ball in a single day. Later steeps require longer durations to get much flavour.

But I was wondering how the ratio of the main chemicals and compounds change across the day? The anti oxidants, the caffeine, and the tannins, any volatile compounds. 

Are early steeps higher in caffeine? The aromatics (what I assume to be volatile compounds) would surely be most potent in the initial steep - my current tea is initially quite floral like roses or potpourri.

First off it took some time for me to appreciate how delicate the tea was.  Fantastic mouthfeel, high mountain dew, opening to delicate floral notes and pear or green apple sweetness. No tannic notes at all, just a fantasticly smooth, delicate tea with a lot to give with numerous steeps. 

After the 3rd steep, (rather quickly as it was so delicate I wanted to experience the flavor after the leaves fully opened. ) I experienced this sudden rush of calm energy. I felt a overwhelming warm relaxation. Then I felt joyful, thankful, euphoric and full of gratitude, even to the point of being giggly. It was short lived as it only lasted a few minutes, but I tried to close my eyes and just be in that moment. It was actually awesome and I wish I could capture that feeling.

Is black tea generally still bitter but less then green tea and usually accompanied by astringency

Is shou puerh neither bitter or astringent 

Obviously there's some teas that will be an exception and you can generally control to a certain extent how bitter or astringent a tea turns out. For example I found jasmine green tea or mint green tea to be generally not bitter, and gunpowder green tea to be possible to with the exact right peramiters, not turn out bitter. But generally most seem to be. Same basic thing for black tea, just to a less extreme outcome. Most come out somewhat bitter and astringent, but with the right peramiters you can almost completely avoid that. The example of an exception for black tea would be Darjeeling second flush, seemingly can be infused at any peramiters and come out without bitterness although may come out with astringency. Meanwhile it seems like, like Darjeeling second flush, shou puerh comes out without bitterness.","personal observations, and desire to confirm others experience this"

Her rule of thumb seemed to be to try to find water that's from the area the tea is from or has a similar quality to the water from there, and I think this works because the water worked great with my sencha but not well with my oolong rock tea, which comes from an area which likely hard harder water than the soft water I bought.

424,tea,"If international shipping were not an issue I'd say probably my two favorite tea sellers still selling I have found are both in the United Kingdom. What Cha and Curious Teas both have:

1. A wide selection of interesting teas; not just the usual suspects. Things like carrying yellow tea and hei cha are a good sign, as are unusual locales (although TWG really burned me here), unusual flavor notes, and tea made from unusual parts of the tea plant. 

2. Curation such that there is a better than average chance that I am going to enjoy a new tea, especially based on the tasting notes. (I generally favor teas that are described as having fruity notes, though if I see something like rose or pepper I'm also inclined to try it.)

3. If something they sell is in stock samples they sell are almost always in stock.

Obviously I'm gonna keep ordering from both of these vendors because they're great and I like trying a lot of vendors. They both have relatively inexpensive, international shipping that becomes free if you meet a threshold that is obviously higher than for the domestic threshold. But on account of trying to meet shipping threshold, plus the fact that I actually have had tea get held up in customs before, I know I will never order from them as frequently as I would if I lived in the United Kingdom, or as often as I do from MEM.

Tea Trekker was probably the closest American equivalent and unfortunately I didn't really have the money to start trying their stuff out for myself until right around the time that Bob retired; but I never realized how fortunate I was that they were local and my father often bought their stuff for me.

I know of several other places in the US that offer some combination of what these two British vendors offer but none of them offer all of them:

* MEM has *really good* curation (even the stuff I don't like is highly distinctive and flavorful) and usually has samples in stock but a relatively small selection and nothing especially interesting; they just do really good versions of your basic stuff.  

* Harney actually has some interesting teas that are well curated, and some teas with some really interesting flavor notes, but most of their good stuff is black tea mostly from Hunan province (they also have some interesting keemuns and golden monkeys, as well as a couple hei chas). They also usually don't even offer samples of the teas that are worth doing from Harney IMO, and when they do the samples are *never* in stock, so you have to take a gamble on a full tin. That *usually* pays off for me with their higher end Chinese teas, but not always.

* Upton generally has samples in stock and some interesting locales, but I at least personally feel they don't curate very well and I have been disappointed more often than not, even when I'm buying just a bunch of samples. I have found a small handful of things I like from them out of dozens of samples.

* The Steeping Room and Yunnan Sourcing's US site have some interesting things but don't really do samples, although they do smaller sizes than Harney. They also don't do curation that I like as much as MEM, Harney, or Curious Teas and What Cha. I've had much better results with both of them than Upton, but I still feel like I'm gambling when I order from them, and I have only found one tea from each of them that I drink fairly regularly.

Obviously the curation quality standard in particular is subjective. I know a lot of you are very happy with Yunnan Sourcing, although generally people are talking about their post-fermented teas and I have personally been large unimpressed with their black tea and I generally use Chinese black tea I am familiar with as a baseline to assess a source.

Chinese black tea comprises an absolute majority of what I drink (with nearly all the rest being black tea from other regions and oolngs), which makes it both the most important thing for a seller to get right and also where I am most confident making statements about quality. When trying a new source I usually use at least two varieties each (if they have at least two kings in samples/small sizes) of keemun, golden monkey, and tong mu/unsmoked lapsang.

But anyways; I'm wondering if anybody has suggestions for US vendors I haven't mentioned that you feel meet the factors I am describing as reasons I like on these two British vendors, especially with a focus on black and oolong tea?",American equivalent of What Cha/Curious Teas?

444,tea,"Hi newbie here. I recently started my loose leaf tea journey getting a gaiwan and learning about gong fu brewing. Got some green tea blends and I'm looking for thw best possible way to taste and enjoy green tea.

For now I've been brewing with 3,5 grams of tea to 75 grams of 80°C water (my gaiwan is not particularly big so I can't get more water inside). First steep is 20 seconds after I poured the water and put the lid on top of the gaiwan (I'm not sure if this is the way to count time; I would start the timer from the moment water touched the leaves). 
I then pour the brewed tea directly into my drinking vessel (no metal mesh for filtering). After that I steep for a second, third or fourth time but just for 10 seconds each, using the same temperature and amount of water of the first infusion. 

Is this okay? Could I do something to highlight the taste of the tea/blend? My brews have been a little astringent so I think that indicates some over-exctraction happening.

This was my first time trying the Sweet Ya Bao from Yunnan Sourcing. It's still a little warm here for hot tea so I only took it to 6 infusions and I'm going to try cold brewing the rest rather than pushing it further.

I finally understand what everyone who raves about this tea has been talking about. If you like white teas, tissanes, herbal teas, etc. this is lovely. It's difficult to describe it exactly, but it's very unique without tasting artificial or like a blend. For the first three infusions, it tasted more sweet and floral but a kind of floral that isn't like most teas with dried flowers mixed in or used for scent. It's somewhat like honeysuckle but it just has its own quality specific to this plant. I did not find it as candy sweet as others have described it but it was a notably sweet tea. Infusions 4-6 were more sour (not unpleasantly so) and I finally understood the watermelon rind description. There's no better comparison for that flavor. I wasn't too taken with the scent (though I am congested). It smelled of wet hay, slightly vegetal/grassy.

My favorite part of this tea is it's appearance. The red blush on these tiny buds is very aesthetically pleasing. The sweetness and floral notes were lovely but I think I want to play around with time/temp a bit. My water was 185F and I made it easy for myself starting with a 10 second infusion and adding another 10 seconds each time.

Store tea in a dry environment----Keep teas in a dry container and stay away from moisture. Dampness and humidity can dramatically reduce the tea's lifespan, and could even cause mold.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep tea away from sunlight- Always keep tea sealed in an airtight container that blocks out all light. Glass jars are not acceptable for tea storage because the sunlight oxidize the substance of tea over time. Keep the tea in a dark and cool place, like a shelf or drawer out of the sunlight because sunlight will produce heat then weaken tea fragrance and change tea quality.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep tea sealed from the air---If tea is sealed in a pouch, make sure that there is as little air as possible when you close the pouch. If you have a vacuum sealer, vacuum- sealed foil bags have the longest shelf life of tea but are not suitable for every tea.Long leaves that are not curled and rolled can be easily crushed under a vacuum. In these cases, make sure to keep your bags sealed between uses and remove excess air.

&amp;#x200B;

Store green tea in the refrigerator--- If you have a vacuum sealer, you can feel free to thoroughly seal your tea in a moisture-free environment, and store it in the refrigerator on a colder setting, or the freezer. Besides, it is better to store your tea with proper amount as the should not be opened too often.",Tea storage

I know it’s best not to oversteep tea, so 2-4minutes depending on the type of tea is ideal. But is it 2-4 minutes no matter if you’re steeping a single cup versus for 4 cups? I ask because I usually steep into a 32 Oz thermos to take with me to work, so I don’t know if it should still be 2-4 minutes for 32oz of water or if I should increase the steeping time to accommodate for the larger volume of water.

I have stovetop tea kettle and recently got a large tea pot along with a filter that you can pour through to catch the tea leaves (like [this](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/strainer-filtering-coffee-tea-pouring-cup-strainer-filtering-coffee-tea-poured-cup-metal-196718795.jpg)).

Before that, I loved the strong black tea flavor of things like Twinings Irish Breakfast, and Yorkshire Gold. The Chinese and Taiwanese black teas from the loose leaf importer I'd been buying from didn't taste much like those ""British Isles"" black tea blends I was accustomed to, and I think that may have something to do with UK &amp; Irish teas being more likely to come from India and ""Ceylon"".

So now I'm wondering what/where I should look for in terms of a high-quality loose leaf black tea blend that's similar to the Irish or English ""Breakfast"" blends one finds in mainstream teabags.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I also don’t have any utensils, and see that they have several starter kits, so I’m not sure if I should get one of the kits or buy utensils separately. I feel like a bamboo whisk is non-negotiable, but I’m not sure about the other products. For example, could I just use a regular bowl instead of their tea bowl, a regular strainer instead of their tea strainer, and a teaspoon instead of the ladle? And do you think a whisk stand would be necessary to store the whisk? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I realize that Ippodo has both US/Canadian websites and sell on Amazon, but even taking into account shipping, their global website seems to be cheaper. My only concern is they have a disclaimer that there may be additional duties/fees depending on the country. I feel like there wouldn’t be, but for those of you who have ordered to the US, have you ever had unexpected charges?

I’ve dumped the tea leaves out and mixed them around to make sure everything is blended properly, I’ve tried brewing at slightly different temps, for slightly different times, with amounts varying from 3g-5g per 8oz mug, I’ve tried several of my filtered water and spring water options, covered and uncovered steeping, an ingenuiTEA bottom dispensing device, a standard extra fine infuser, and so on.

I thought at first that maybe, since I'd accidentally left it close to the stove, some bacon grease had got on it or something. I gently (emphasis on gently) rinsed and rubbed with my fingers to try to coax the hypothetical grease off, but the paint just smeared all over my fingers.

The paint has the texture of greasy honey, and will leave a nasty, water resistant smear on my finger with even the slightest touch.  The surface, which used to be matte, is now glossy. It's as if something has chemically dissolved and altered the lacquer.

So, I was always OK with tea, but I am usually a coffee drinker.

Back in my youth I would drink green tea (although I always left the teabag in, and I would actually end up getting nausea nearing the end of the cup), Chamomile (which was very nice) and black tea with milk (I think I always ended up going back to earl grey)

A few years ago I tasted a berry flavored tea of a pretty expensive brand called Althaus and I was **blown away** by how good it was. Absolutely delicious, even though it was just a standard tea bag.

761,tea,"Hey everyone,

I recently got into making tea after I visited the store of Mariage Freres in London. I bought some nice tea and I am ready to enjoy it. However, I came to the realization that picking a teapot is more complicated than one would originally expect. 

Therefore, I am asking you guys for advice. After going through the rabbit hole, I discovered the following:

\- People prefer glass teapots (as it is easier to clean and it is seethrough) 

\- Stainless steel strainers are very good in contrast to glass ones

\- Some teapots have an ""anti-drip"" pout

\- Brands can really make the difference in terms of longevity of usage.

\- Not more than 600 ml?

Now, I have spent countless hours digging online and searching for teapots, but not a single one seems to be fitting all these criteria (plus shipping to NL without ridiculous costs). Some are very big (1500ml), and others have no brand (could break easily), or the strainer does not reach very low (which is an issue if you want to make little amounts of tea). 

For now, I was thinking of these two, but neither one seems to be a 10/10 for me:

I adored them both (I just found it funny because I am American and really only liked coffee before this, and I only drank it to keep me awake) but the breakfast tea was easily my favorite, and became my comfort beverage. I went to the store and got some Irish Breakfast tea (became my second favorite), also by Twinings.

Some time later (last week ish) I went and got some Earl Grey cause good old Picard, and I was surprised to find that I did not like it as much, easily my least favorite tea. I would also like to note that I have drunk all these teas black (I also frequently drank all my coffee black, sometimes putting in a flavored creamer if i felt fancy), without milk and/or sugar. I figured that milk was quite a bit different than the flavored creamers for coffee, so I am a bit hesitant to try it, I can only imagine the two flavors separate from the tea.

First question, how does milk affect the taste, and what kind of milk do you recommend for tea? Second is should I put milk in earl grey? The citrus-y taste seems like it wouldn't pair well with, well *milk*, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

831,tea,"I've only enjoyed drinking tea for a couple years now.  And I go back and forth between a couple opposite methods.  I'm wondering, which produces more caffeine (to choose this way in the morning), and which produces cup with less caffeine?

Oh, and this would be using PG Tips bags or similar.

Method One, for a strong-but-mild (less tannins) -- MORE tea Bags, like 5 or 6 bags, in less-hot water (when my kettle says it has reached 190-degrees), steeped Only Less than One Minute.  I may or may not add a little extra water to my mug after removing the teabags, and this makes a strong-but-mild tea that i can enjoy black OR with cream-n-sweetener.

Method Two, for stronger and more-tannin tea --- LESS tea Bags, only 2 or 3 bags, in the Hottest water (my kettle goes to 209-degrees F), steeped longer (maybe 5 minutes, or whenever I happen to come back to my cup).  I also, may or may not, add additional warm water to the mug. This Requires Lots of Cream and More Sweetener, for me to enjoy drinking it.

I’m asking because I previously thought tea had next to no caffeine, like maybe 1/20th of a cup of coffee, but I read on google that a cup of tea is equal to half a cup of coffee in terms of caffeine.

This worries me because i’ve replaced my coffee with tea as caffeine makes me incredibly anxious and jittery. And i’ve noticed today after having 4 cups of tea, that while i never really felt the energetic boost, I do feel a kind of crash similar to when I would have 1 cup of coffee.

I sometimes add cream to my tea and it's usually making it tastier. But *this* was plain.

1040,tea,"Intro:

Pulled the trigger and managed to get a lüni teapot. I'd like to offer my initial impression and beginner's perspective as the world of yixing teaware appears to be riddled with myth, exaggeration, and sensationalism. Hopefully this post will help people who might be interested in obtaining a yixing teapot make that final decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Experiment: 

The lüni teapot was compared to a ceramic cup with a steel strainer. The strainer had adequate space for the leaves to unfurl. I was trying several types of green teas, white teas, and shu puer as these were the teas that were suggested for lüni use. The lüni teapot was not seasoned. The amount of tea leaves, water, and temperature of the water for the comparison were standardized.

&amp;#x200B;

General Findings:

Overall, I found that the lüni teapot **removed some of the astringency and bitterness** of certain teas (please see below for specific findings). For me, differences are minor and you would really need to concentrate and really look for those differences (i.e. Nothing terribly groundbreaking). If let's say you were enjoying a meal with your tea, I doubt you would notice anything too drastic. In terms of heat retention, I found that the  lüni teapot had better heat retention than the ceramic cup; this is likely due to the fact that clay has a higher heat capacity than ceramic. As a result, I found was if you pre-heat both cups (I poured boiling water and threw the water out) and then placed the tea leaves with the water used for brewing, the  lüni teapot keeps the tea warmer for longer. Alternatively, I found that not pre-heating the  lüni teapot means that your brew starts off in a lower temperature. This can be used to your advantage if you don't have an electrical kettle that cannot control the temperature of the water you're heating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Specific Tea Findings:

Sencha - Lowers maximum bitterness; however, it does mildly lower some of the umami flavor.  I am fond of using higher and higher temperatures for subsequent brews on sencha and I found that  lüni teapot helps remove some of the excess astringency and bitterness

White Teas, Chinese Green Teas, and  Shu Puers- Lowers maximum bitterness. I could not detect any flavors or aromas that were removed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:

Overall, I wouldn't say that getting a yixing is the best bang for buck in brewing tea. Controlling brew time and water temperature are still bigger factors in affecting tea taste. You also need to consider the fact that most yixing teapots tend to range from \~100 mL - 300 mL in capacity. If you're the type that likes to brew a large amount of tea all at once, it might not be a good idea to get a yixing teapot. 

I'll continue to see if the effects of the  lüni teapot changes as it absorbs some of the aroma and oils from the tea leaves I am currently using.",A Beginner's Perspective/Initial Impression on a Yixing Teapot

The second one I've tried, however - the uji gyokuro gokou - is very astrigent and floral, and lacks those savoury, umami notes altogether. It might be okay if I were expecting to be drinking a sencha, but this doesn't fit my expectation of a gyokuro at all. The reviews were pretty good on that one, so I'm a little surprised.

They're both limited to a cocoa powder aroma on top of a boring malt base. I don't find complexity there. No symphony of overlapped aromatics waiting to be teased out with another sip. Not even simple crowd-pleasers like flowers or fruits that can make up for a lack of complexity, like in jasmine greens.

It feels like all the grassy/flowery/fruity aromatics have been lost in an almost complete oxidation. Am I missing something?

The sweet spot of taste profile complexity seems to be in the partial oxidation of white teas and oolongs, but I also enjoy green and fermented teas - even the earthy simplicity of a cheap Shu Pu-erh. Why can't I find something interesting in Hong Cha?

1239,tea,"A couple months ago, I accidentally bought a strainer to use as tea steeper and of course it was very difficult to brew tea out of it. But then I tried pouring the hot water closer to the strainer. I poured the water slowly in a circle, like making a drip coffee. Interestingly, it instantly became just about the strength I enjoy. (I used to brew very light about 2.5 minutes at 90 degrees Celsius) Since then I mostly brew teas like that. Even with tea bags, when I hold the tea bag a little higher and directly pour the water over the bag, I have no need to wait for it to brew anymore. 

It is quite different when the tip of the jug is quite far off from the tea leaves or if the water has cooled down some bit, then it is like brewing any other time. Have to wait a couple minutes to get the flavour out. In one part, it makes me slightly guilty cuz I am basically throwing away a 15 seconds brewed tea ;0

Now it makes me quite curious about the science behind this. I searched up drip tea, but all I could find was the slow drip green tea, which also seemed to wait a couple minutes before draining the water down, so quite different from what I do.

I wonder if any other people brew tea like me, and if it even have a name. Any thoughts? :P",drip tea method?

*The Tea Industry of Western Hubei* is Comrade Teng Zhenbo’s summation of his long work in the Enshi tea region. The content is rich and theory is paired well with practice. It has reference value regarding the development of tea production in Western Hubei and related technical skills.

\-Wang Zhenheng

Anhui Agricultural Academy 1985.

Hubei Province has produced tea since ancient times, including many of our nation’s most famous teas. Hubei’s border-bound teas have an especially long history. Such tea has made a unique contribution in the unity of ethnic minority border areas. It also brought the attentions of the Russian Empire, whose warships siezed Hankou (Wuhan), then one of the world’s three greatest tea markets, taking the border-bound tea there along with the Mongolian market. Ultimately, they instigated Mongolia’s separation from China, losing many a mountain and stream for our country. The competition that goes on within the tea market is no less fierce than what soldiers do on the field. One must get a sense of this fact if the story of Enshi’s tea is to be understood.

At the beginning of the 18th Century, Gongfu black tea was being sold to the world and the *Yihong* grown in Enshi was a unique and well known component of that trade. Later, it was India and Sri Lanka that would suddenly take over the world market. Yihong tea production never recovered from the resulting drop in black tea exports.

Enshi Yulu is a famous tea unique for the continued tradition of steamed processing that has been passed down since the Tang Dynasty. It is an equal rival to Japanese *Gyokuro*, and may even surpass the later tea, now winning the appreciation of the Japanese people. Considerable export of Enshi Yulu continues to that country. 

MR. Teng graduated from Anhui Agricultural Academy’s tea training course in 1953, accepting the organization’s placement in the Enshi tea region, where he passionately set himself to his work, making use of the Western Hubei’s rich tea industry traditions and visiting every corner of Enshi. This book is a combinationis based on both years of surveying in Enshi along with current scientific knowledge. Recently, X publishing company has taken up the publication of this book, and I have been earnestly requested once again to provide a foreword. Should I fail to do so now would blemish further the natural affinity that should be had between teacher and student. Last year I had read the work in question, the work you are reading now, yet as some time I passed I forgot about the matter altogether. Such actions are cause for concern and do not reflect the great quality of this work.

Chen Chuan

Anhui Agricultural Academy 1985.

**前言 -** **Author’s** **Introduction** 

*Research on the Western Hubei Tea Industry* systematically summarizes the production and marketing of tea within our autonomous prefecture. Based on the practical realities of Enshi, it is essential that technical theory be a guide to action. This could let economic openness accomplish greater successes and benefits the deepening of technical improvement in tea production. Towards this end, close cropping has replaced wide spaced planting. In a population sparce, culturally undeveloped, and highly mountainous old tea growing region such as Enshi, such a technical change must be called a great progress. Overall however, objective limitations arising from topological and transportation realities means that Enshi tea production lags behind in the relevant scientific and technological innovations. 

*Enshi Tea Research* introduces the conceptions of tea that kept pre-liberation production, especially that of Enshi between 1942 and 1959, stuck at a mere 30,000 tons. This 17 years of stagnation was what inspired us to seriously study the problems of Enshi tea production.

In the 1950s we came to Enshi, and made a full survey of the land and extant tea fields. We did also tea-oriented agricultural extension work. At that time, there was a sincere wish among the broad masses to restore and reclaim lost tea fields such that production levels could recover. The degeneration of the tea industry after decades of foreign and civil wars was acute at that time. In 60’s and 70’s it recovered, yet the recovery emphasized only a numerical growth of tea production. Quantity was demanded rather than quality. Only in the 1980’s has tea production began to become a more strictly scientific enterprise.

Tea is a profound discipline. Planting is the foundation, yet pre-production, processing, selling, grading, and mechanical equipment expertise are also all of critical importance. The Enshi people put great hope in the development of our field.

The Enshi Autonomous Prefecture was founded on December 1st 1983. The establishment of our prefecture is a boon to the sovereignty rights of the indigenous minorities there. China is the motherland of tea, and Enshi is a core contributor. Enshi’s Hefeng, Xuanen, and Badong counties have all produced imperial tribute teas. The diverse teas historically once produced still survive today in limited forms and should be fully made use of.  

**本书基本要- This Work’s** **Goals** 

Overall yield in Enshi is however still quite poor and must remain our primary task. By the year 2000 someone has predicted that the Enshi Autonomous Area will be able to produce a total of 22 million kilograms of tea, 200% of the 1985 harvest 【Enshi's 2020 harvest was 21.4 million】. I however think such a prediction is unscientific. Whether or not Enshi could reach such a goal requires further research and technical advancement. Work like this book must continue if any progress at all is to be made. 

1.) Combination of theoretical and practical knowledge.

2.) Comprehensive understanding of tea cultivation, picking, production, and sales. Xuenen County is the leader is Enshi today precisely because producers there have grasped all the concepts involved. Producers must be part farmer, part worker, and part merchant if their enterprise is to succeed.

3.) Since Enshi is a tea growing region with a long history, it is essential to give a full account of the area’s past and present experience. Whereas in the past only quantitative tea yield was sought, now there is a push towards qualitatively improving tea production through new methods. Restating black tea production is one aspect of the present era. 

**鄂西茶叶分布及生产概况**

**Distribution and Status of Tea Production in Enshi**

**近代茶叶史General Modern History**

Enshi is divided presently into six counties (including Hefeng and Jianshi) and two cities (Enshi and Lichuan), administratively speaking. For the last 100 or so years, there has been historical record of the many changes that have take place in border hinterlands such as Enshi. It is recorded in the *The Shinan Almanac* that Hefeng was not a part of Enshi, being a totally unconnected and seperate county all the way up to the 1911 Revolution. The Almanac also metions that late Qing Dynasy tea tax revenue for the area amounted to just 0.75 *taels* of silver. Without Hefeng County and modernized production, it is clear that the tea industry was not thriving in Enshi in the late Qing, despite its long history.

In the first year of the Republic (1912), the newly established Central Bank of China produced a report titled *The* *Third and Fourth Quarter Economic Situation* mentioned Enshi’s economic situation. Now including Hefeng County, it was written that the military situation in Enshi had stabilized, the population was growing, and commerce appeared to be developing in a prosperous direction. The area’s only products were listed as tea (30,000 dan), hemp (3000 dan), and dansheng (200 dan). Although tea was already Enshi’s number one product, the tea produced there was said to have a “poor reputation and low status.”  

Another Republican era document, *The Chinese Economic Yearbook*, listed Enshi’s Hefeng County as one of Hubei’s major tea produces areas alongside of Xianning’s Tongcheng and Chibi Counties, Huangshi’s Yangxin County, and Yichang’s Zigui County. That same document opined that “tea in this region of Southern China was widespread but little more than a side industry for subsistence grain farmers. Tea plots were usually scattered among hundreds or thousands of mu of field crops or planted in high mountain forests, making them hard to survey. It can however be said that tea is rarely grown at any scale of production, nor are intentional tea plantations numerous.""

At the time of *Liberation* in 1949, the Enshi Zone was found to have the greatest quantity of tea fields, tea processing, and commercial tea. Topographical and transportation factors have subsequently kept the growth of Enshi tea production slow despite the real gains that have been made. 

This is all I know of Enshi tea’s general history. Others should continue the work on this front, as an ignorance of history was the weakness of men in my generation. Below, more information will be given about specific areas and teas. 

**鹤峰县 Hefeng County** 

Hefeng County’s tea is said by all to have a long history. How long a history? In 1867, it was recorded that tea was being cultivated in the county. A 1946 Kuomintang  Government report stated that Hefeng tea was suitable for international export. County tea production was estimated to have already exceeded 1,000 *dan* in the late Qing Dynasty. It was additionally one of five major tea growing areas listed in the Republican Era *China Economic Yearbook* for Hubei Province. It was able to attain such a status in part thanks to the county’s low population and large tracts of reclaimable land.

After Communist Victory in 1949, 20,000 Mu of scattered tea fields were connected and expanded into 30,000 Mu by just 1953. Hefeng’s tea growth has been relatively fast.  Tea production almost tripled from 4,900 *dan* in 1949 to 14,000 in 1970 at the height of the Cultural Revolution. It more than doubled again, growing to 35,000 *dan* by 1987. Some 31,000 *dan* of this stock of tea was actually consumed that year in collective or market sales. Hefeng today accounts for more than 40% of all the tea produced in Hefeng County. Emphasis on quantity rather than quality of production has given Hefeng such impressive sounding numbers. Outside of the state-run Zouma plantation, per *mu* tea production in Hefeng is around 50 *jin* lower than the provincial average.  

The Zouma Tea Production Zone (ZTPZ),  started in the 1950’s, has become a critical component of Hefeng’s county’s tea history. When the zone was established 1953, the area was not well known for tea. The state-run tea plantation became a model for surrounding communes. The plantation itself now covers some 14000 Mu of land. Of all of Enshi’s tea producing zones, only the ZTPZ has reached 10,000 *dan* in production.",Unpublished Manuscript of Enshi Tea Maker： Translation 1

I very much like the umami, savoury, and sometimes seaweedy tastes of Japanese greens.   


Since trying to return to matcha, however, I'm finding I'm not liking it much. I've been trying to drink it in a more traditional way (unsweetened, no milk, etc.) but I've not found it to be pleasant thusfar - it always seems bitter, sometimes astringent, and sometimes almost soapy. This is obviously more pronounced in the lower grades, but I've even found that to be true of the 3+ ceremonial grade matchas that I've tried. I'm hesitant to waste more money on trying more, but I feel stubborn to make a good cup of matcha. I do not yet have a whisk or sifter, so perhaps that's the problem? But I do try and whisk it with a fork to the best of my ability to aerate and simulate having a whisk. Should I just make the investment in the proper tools, or is that a bit ambitious given I'm not even sure if I'll like it?

tl,dr: tea in thermos for hours is bland, plz help

--

Tea at work can be a particular challenge. Every working day for me is spent travelling. I have a small thermos, about 500ml (stays happily hot for hours), and a small collapsable electric kettle for heating water. Water at work normally means bottled water from Dasani (I don't get to choose).

Before a trip I will pre-fill empty tea bags with a loose leaf tea. These days it's normally something like an Assam from Ahmad tea. Something not terribly pricey, because the situation is not ideal.

In the hotel room before work each morning I steep one of the bags in the thermos, seal it up, and drink the tea at work after things have calmed down a bit.

The tea can taste rather bland this way. Sometimes I'll over-steep it on purpose just to get that heavy astringent taste, but that's not ideal. When I work afternoons and can just drink tea in my hotel room it's better.

For context, at home I love many sorts of tea, not limited to Japanese green teas, white teas from China, inexpensive Darjeeling, etc. I generally follow accepted guidence for amount, temperature and timing when I make them.

Does anyone have any ideas what may work better while travelling? I can't make tea while working. It doesn't need to be stellar, I'm just wondering if anyone has a suggestion tea-wise or technique-wise that may offer more flavor.

A different tea that will hold up better? A different way of making it? Stronger? Upside-down? I'm open to suggestions.

I'm not picky, honest. I've been doing this for well over a year and it has transformed my work day. I love tea way more than any coffee I could get while working.

https://white2tea.com/products/2018-sun-fu

What I did: I treated it like I generally do for a shou, figuring any heicha should be roughly similar. (This may have been a terribly bad assumption!) Western style but on the strong side, 6-7 g leaf to 16 oz boiling water. Gave it a good rinse, then steeped 3 minutes.... I wanted to sip my tea slowly over a few hours as I did other things, rather than drinking it steadily before it got cold, so I put it in an insulated flask to pour out small portions.

What I got: The taste really put me off. It seemed very very heavy on sour hay, with a prominent medicinal backtaste. I struggled to finish my first steep (was hoping it would grow on me), and I gave up when the second steep didn't seem toned down at all. Tossed the liquid, tossed the leaves, brewed something else. I rarely do that, even for a new tea that goes on my ""don't buy again"" list.

It did not have any flavor I recognize as ""water too hot"" or ""steeped too long"" or ""too much/little leaf."" But maybe those problems taste different with this style than with other teas?

So... any thoughts? Does it sound like something went wrong with brewing? Is this vintage just at an awkward age? Or is this an expected flavor profile, maybe an acquired taste, and I'm just not into it?",W2T 2018 Sun Fu

Do they use the art design painted on gaiwan as a guide to make sure they pour from the same spot of the bowl lip?

I see another way to avoid it is to hold just the lid knob and the bottom of the saucer to pour, but it is not commonly used, and it has it own issues such as the spilled tea or water sitting on the saucer would end up on the tea cup or on the counter/table without using a tea tray.

I've had a dream of starting my own small tea farm for years now and the few Sinensis tea farms that were attempted in my area over the last century just have not done well due in part to climate. Both Camellia Japonica and Camellia Sasanqua do very well where I live and are extremely popular as ornamental plants. So of course now I want to try treating them as one would a Sinensis plant.

Lately, I’ve been hearing more and more about tea grown in America. From North Carolina, to Oregon, to Washington, it seems like more farmers are becoming interested in tea and processing it here. I’ve yet to see any that’s widely available, but it’s an exciting idea. 

I just finished a course on the terroir of tea (specifically in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan). Even in the same styles of tea with similar plants, the liquor is completely different depending on where the tea was grown, and it has gotten me thinking about the flavor possibilities for these new farms. 

Has anyone had a chance to cup American-grown tea? I’m normally a purist when it comes to country of origin for my tea, but I am just insanely intrigued by this stuff, especially since I live in an area where the tea plant would thrive. I haven’t been able to find much information about it online (not even which tea plants they’re working with) so I was wondering if anyone else had any info/opinions/experience on the topic.",American-Grown Tea?

There is a general feeling that we do it best and people will pour scorn over Americans and their brewing methods for example. But the British are, on the whole terrible at making tea and generally drink poor quality tea. The overwhelming majority of tea consumed is low quality bagged black tea  with boiling water poored on it and sugar added. Milk and sugar is used to mask the taste of over heated, over steeped low quality tea. Compare this to other nations with a love of tea in the middle East, India, Central Europe and East Asia and things don't stack up well. 

This maybe wasn't always the case but the tradition of tea houses and careful preparation in the home has all but died. This may be in part because in the UK it was always a tradition of the upper classes and ultimately rooted in colonialism. This is in contrast to some of the other regions mentioned where tea was always drank by all. The tea drank by most now is a sorry state of affairs. So what is everyone's thoughts on tea in the UK?

Obviously, it's not actually ""tea"" but more of a tisane/herbal drink... however, there are apparently subtle similarities to green tea. I'm fascinated by this, and hoping some of you could share more about it, its taste, and really anything else.   


A few things I've learned in research (and talking with the owner of one farm):

* It's been around and known as Kuti (Africa) or Kahwa Daun (India)
* It tastes nothing like coffee; in fact, it's closer to green tea but apparently sweeter and silkier. 
* It's super low in caffeine (this surprised me) with only around 15-20mg per 8 oz cup.
* The content level of mangiferin (the magic molecule EGCG) in coffee leaves is very high (higher than even green tea!). 
* This could serve as another income stream for producers of coffee, a known issue with coffee productions limited time frame, and benefit the workers by providing more work throughtout the year
* There are German cafes using coffee-leaf matcha for matcha lattes (apparently it needs half the amount as regular matcha)
* There's a Kenyan chef that uses coffee-leaf matcha in foods/recipes (not surprising, but cool)  


I know there's a Canadian company that made RTD cans with a coffee-leaf tea base (Wize?). I just got off the phone with the owner of a coffee-leaf tea estate, and it was a really cool conversation.

1455,tea,"When brewing tea, high water temperature will strengthen the bitterness and low water temperature will weaken the bitterness. The water used for brewing tea will also affect the taste of the tea soup, so you should pay attention to the water temperature and water quality when brewing tea.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tea brewing water temperature

**High temperature**

The so-called high temperature refers to the water temperature above 90℃, and the teas that are suitable for high temperature brewing are: partially fermented tea leaves, such as Tieguanyin, rock tea, dongding, etc., and fully fermented tea (such as black tea), as well as Pu-erh black tea, all need to be brewed at high temperature. Among them, Tieguanyin and Pu'er tea can even be brewed at a temperature of 95°C or higher.

**Medium Temperature**

Medium temperature refers to the water temperature of 80\~90℃. The tea leaves suitable for medium temperature brewing are: the bud tea of partially fermented tea, such as Bai Hao Oolong; and the white tea, such as Bai Hao Yinzhen, Shou Mei, etc. White hairs oolong is suitable for water temperature of 85℃, and white hairs silver needle is suitable for brewing at 80℃.

　　In addition, if the tea leaves that should be brewed at high temperature are tender because of the buds and leaves, or if the tea leaves become finer due to human factors, the water temperature should be lowered and medium temperature water should be used for brewing. For example, dongding, alpine oolong and baozhong are sometimes more tender due to the early picking time, so the water temperature should not exceed 90℃.

**Low Temperature**

Low temperature refers to the water temperature between 70\~80℃, and the teas suitable for low temperature brewing are: all green teas, such as Longjing, Biluochun, Sencha, etc.; and yellow teas, such as Junshan Silver Needle. If the tea leaves should be brewed at medium temperature, the water temperature should also be lowered if the tea leaves are tender or become finer.

&amp;#x200B;

# Water quality for tea brewing

The water chosen by the Chinese for brewing tea has 5 characteristics: clear（清）, live（活）, light（轻）, gan（甘） and cold（冽）.

**Clear**: it is required to be colorless and transparent, without precipitates. This is the most basic requirement, but also a common sense.

**Live**: the so-called live is to use flowing water.

**Light**: this is a standard of the ancients, modern science, the use of chemical analysis, the water containing more than 8 mg of calcium and magnesium ions per milliliter is called hard water, less than 8 mg is called soft water, hard water is heavier than soft water. Experimental evidence, with soft water tea, color and flavor are good; with hard water tea, the tea soup discoloration, fragrance is also greatly inferior.

**Gan**: the so-called Gan is the water a mouth, the tongue and cheeks between the sweet feeling, where the water spring Gan can help tea flavor.

**Cold**: The ancients believed that cold water, especially ice water, snow water, the best taste. This view also has its own basis, the water in the crystallization process, impurities sink, the crystallization of ice is relatively pure. As for snow water, more valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

# Types of water

**Spring water**: Generally speaking, in natural water, spring water is more refreshing, less impurities, high transparency, less pollution, the best water quality.

**River water**: tea water, although spring water is better, but stream water, river water and river water and other perennial flow of water, used to make tea is not inferior.

**Rainwater, snow water**: rainwater and snow water is known to the ancients as ""heavenly spring"". With snow water to brew tea, has always been valued. Autumn, the sky is high, less dust, rain clean, bubble tea taste crisp and sweet; rainy season, and wind and rain, conducive to the growth of microorganisms, bubble tea quality is less, summer thunderstorms, often accompanied by flying sand and rocks, water quality is not clean, for bubble tea tea soup turbid, not suitable for drinking.

**Tap water**: tap water a are artificially purified, disinfected river water or lake water. It would be better if there is a water purifier.

1543,tea,"Today I am going to share with you some of the common tea brewing tools used by the Chinese. Some are suitable for use while driving, and some are suitable for hosting friends.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ceramic cups/glass cups** 

https://preview.redd.it/df4hgpgbm2i91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57de04f88c706b4c986c5df0426d0f90e6303bae

Ordinary ceramic cups or glass cups are the most common tea brewing tools used by the Chinese, especially for brewing green tea. We put the tea leaves directly into the cup, pour in hot water, and start drinking tea after 1-2 minutes. The transparent glass allows you to see the changes in the tea leaves during the brewing process, which is also a pleasure, for example, when brewing Duyun Mao Jian you can see the process of the tea leaves changing from dragonfly-like dried tea to tea buds.

This way is different from the complicated brewing method described in many websites, but it is very efficient, for example, you can get a cup of tea quickly when you are at work. This is the easiest and most common way to make tea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mug with strainer**

https://preview.redd.it/f54uqcsgm2i91.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c95747eea1236366c89be91bdd6d365d2440a4

This is a common way of brewing tea while driving. All you need to do is brew a cup of tea before you get in the car and you can drink the tea directly during the drive without worrying about eating it. This also applies to traveling or hiking.

This is also a very common way to brew tea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Puffy Cup** 

https://preview.redd.it/6ugh794jm2i91.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41344b3a74861cb67c22f786388bc8bb6b6ef71c

I'm not sure if the English translation of this cup is correct, so if you want to buy one you can try searching with the picture. These cups were very popular over 10 years ago and every household had one.

This tea cup is very convenient to brew tea. You just need to put the tea leaves into the strainer and then pour in boiling water, after the tea leaves have steeped for the right amount of time press the button at the top and the tea broth will flow out of the strainer while the tea leaves are still in the strainer, at which point you can pour it out and drink. This tea cup separates the tea broth and tea leaves very well, and you can control the tea steeping time to get the brewing effect you want.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kung Fu Tea Set** 

https://preview.redd.it/o4dnkreom2i91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f41997f5f20e10f8e7dd128e99fb5cd11b94096f

Kung Fu tea set is currently the most popular tea brewing tool in China. Its origin is Chaoshan, as Chaoshan people went to do business all over the country, Kung Fu tea set gradually became popular in China.

Kungfu tea sets usually consist of tea cups, gaiwan, and gongdao cups. Some sets will add teapots or other tools, but the way of brewing tea is very similar. I am actually trying to sell Chinese kung fu tea sets and teacups, so if you are interested you can chat with me and I will send you a link and discount code.

Using a kung fu tea set to brew tea can be a bit more complicated than the previous tools, so it is often used to host friends. It is a great way to show respect to your friends through the etiquette of brewing tea, and is perfect for tea parties.

I have posted a video about how to brew tea with a kung fu tea set in a previous post, and I welcome anyone to discuss with me about brewing tea.

**Purple Sand Pot** 

https://preview.redd.it/o2w7iz3qm2i91.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2bf1f4d03ccb32d03aac44fc5d6c422b983e8b7

Teapots have been used in China for thousands of years. I am here to introduce the most famous Zisha pots.

The making of a Zisha pot is a very complex process and a UN intangible cultural heritage. The material selection, pot design and production process of quality Zisha pots are amazing. A quality Zisha pot is very expensive, up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many tea lovers will collect Zisha pots.

To brew tea in a zisha pot.

1. Pour a small amount of boiling water into the pot, shake the pot, followed by filling it with 1/2 of the water, moistening it and pouring it out. This is to heat the teapot and clean it

2, Put the tea into the pot, the amount of tea used depends on the taste and the size of the pot, usually about 1/5 of the teapot.

3、After filling the teapot with boiling water, strain out the tea broth and pour it off after a short stay, this is tea washing.

4、Pour in the hot water again to brew, you can cover the pot with a lid to moisten.

5、Pour out the tea broth for drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

**You can choose the tea set according to your own preference and actual situation, I always insist on one principle: the tool that suits you is the best tool!**

1548,tea,"I used to order my tea from YunnanSourcing, Taiwansourcing, Verdant Tea, White2Tea, Eco-Cha, etc to explore teas and discover types of dancong, wuyi, and oolongs.  Now that I know my preference I usually order my tea from [wangtea.tw](https://wangtea.tw)  有記名茶 - I almost always order a large amount of Tieguanyin and roasted oolong and a few of green oolong and black tea.  I would also order Puer from YunnanSourcing  every year and age them as gifts for my family and relatives.  


Recently my SIL, her parents, and her brother, a GM for a 2 Michelin-star Taiwanese yum-cha restaurant, recommend a distributor with a website to order from - they have retail price and wholesale price (whole sale is usually minimum 5 斤 (3000grams) of each product).  The issue is, I have never tried their tea, but my in-laws vouched for them.    


So I add every product to my cart and it comes up to $1800 ish for about 4000grams of tea of various quality.  Most affordable is around $18/ 100gram and the most expensive is around $85/100gram.    


I can afford it, but I feel it is a bit nuts to spend this much just to expand my tea knowledge, especially when I have never even tasted the tea. But I am very, very low on tea.  I have less than 400 grams of tea left at home and I plan on splurging to restock and do a tea tasting for my family and friends.  


What do my fellow tea enthusiasts and fanatics think?  Should I reduce the amount or  go fucking nuts and go on a spending spree and not have to buy much tea for the next 2 to 3 years?

1549,tea,"During summers I often get reminded of a particular cup of tea. It was at the beginning of my journey into tea.

I had just ended my first serious relationship and was living in a tiny one room student apartment for a couple of months. I had started drinking a bit more ""premium"" tea a couple of months before, and used a small 50ml chaozhou teapot.

The day was hot and it started raining lightly. I had ordered some aged oolong, I think it was Dong Ding from Essence of Tea, and was impatiently waiting for it to arrive. I had not yet tasted any aged tea, and was super interested in aged oolong for some reason. 

Lastly I got the message, and quickly ran my bicycle to the post office and back. Back home I put some music on, sat on my window sill and sipped the tea. By that time the rain had stopped and it was hot and sunny again. The scent of the warm pavement after a summer rain mixed with the unmistakable aroma of aged oolong. I was relaxed and a bit bittersweet but content.

To this day aged oolong smells like a summer sunset to me. I have not drunk aged oolong for a while now, but often jump back to this moment during summer rain showers.

Am i doing something wrong if none of the infusions actually taste and have maybe a small lingering taste, but those do smell really good. The taste is like you could serve me 3 different ones and i would taste 0 difference. It's basically just like drinking colored warm water that has been in the same room with tea. 

What i currently do: since i want to test out different ones i have to buy bag teas since there isn't a tea shop easily accessible when grocery shopping. I see what the temp should be (has been 100C on all) and i boil the water, pour it into a cup and let the tea sit in there for the recommended time. Then since it's an infusion and doesn't get bitter (has no tea in it) i taste it and usually leave the bag in for more time, but it has no effect on the taste whatsoever. Every time it smells so nice and exactly like the package suggest, but the taste just doesn't exist... I just had rooibos, strawberry, vanilla infusion which didn't taste like strawberry or vanilla at all (i don't know what rooibos tastes like) it smelled like vanilla and strawberry tho and had good color.

&amp;#x200B;

**2021 Black Buds Jin Jun Mei (Recommend)**

A relatively okay JJM! This tea had a nice and deep aroma, and also packed a semi-potent cha-qi. It lacked in flavour depth and texture, as well as finish and aftertaste. I think I may have forgotten to clean my kettle though, as the liquor felt like I was drinking hard water, even though I remember using my filtered water. Not including the water situation into the review of this tea, I think the tea is a edging the okayish decent and mediocre range.

Notes:  Cherries, Chocolate, Kiwi, Malt, Plum, Raisins, Spices 

Score: 70/100

&amp;#x200B;

**2022 Shi Feng Dragonwell (Recommend)**

A crisp and delicate green! For its price range, this tea will knock most other Longjings out of the park. Strong aroma, vibrant liquor, with an exceptional longevity, this tea is pretty decent. It also surprisingly had a nice cha-qi and decent texture too! The downsides of this tea however is that its flavour is just missing something, a little body, or complexity. I wished it offered more in the taste as well as the finish, which is why I am not giving the tea an 80+.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes: Citrus Rind, Creamy, Guava, Roasted Nuts, Vanilla, Vegetable Broth, Vegetal

Score: 77/100 

&amp;#x200B;

**2022 Spring Traditional Tieguanyin (Don't recommend)**

An okay-ish mediocre tea. While this tea wasn’t bad, it wasn’t anything special either. It had a weak taste and a thin texture, with little complexity in taste and character. This tea however was redeemed with a nice finish and a really strong and complex aroma. Other than that though, it may be better to look elsewhere for a traditional Tieguanyin.

Notes: Beer, Cherries, Cream, Fried Garlic, Honey, Leather, Malt, Tangy 

Score: 66/100

&amp;#x200B;

**2021 Wild Bai Mu Dan (Don't recommend)**

Not the most exciting tea, and it is just mediocre at best. One-dimensional flavour profile with a weak finish and aftertaste, lacking any noticeable cha-qi and character to the tea. It has a somewhat nice texture and aroma, though. A lackluster tea in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes: Tofu, Egg White, Soybean, Water Spinach 

Score: 61/100

&amp;#x200B;

**2020 Laoshan Black (Don't recommend)**

Got this as a free sample from the order. It tasted like a dilute Wuyi Yancha, missing a body, texture, finish, everything really. Very few teas make me feel like puking but this one almost did. I’m lucky I only have 5g of this tea. There really isn't anything to shout about for this tea. Maybe Verdant Tea gave me a stale sample, considering its a 2020 tea, or its a sign of the quality of their Laoshan blacks.

So I stopped drinking coffee a few months ago because it was a bit « too stimulating » for me, followed by a crash after a few hours. (I am VERY sensitive to stimulants in general)

I started looking for something smoother, and that lasts longer, when I discovered Guayusa (I was not a tea drinker in the first place but I read it was a good coffee replacement)

Guayusa tasted good, was also very stimulating with a smoother feeling, no jittery or anything, and it was basically perfect for me… except for one thing, it lasts way too long. To the point it ruins my sleep every time I take it, and leaves me exhausted the next day if I don’t drink any of it again..

I read this tea lasted pretty long but it’s too much for me.
Do you know by any chance if there is any other kind of tea that has the same stimulating effect, but doesn’t last that long ?

1621,tea,"Its not bad! Came across two boxes of this stuff at a local chinese herb store. Paid 2.50 CAD a box. Have never tried any of the recent shui xian but i can tell this stuff is old because of the box art and packaging compared to other sea dyke teas.  

Interestingly, the bag inside the box while brand new had an open top, which... may have contributed to some aging! Thought i could taste some pu erh notes in there. Not an expert on aging oolongs/tea generally so im tentative on that. 

Pretty mellow tea, while complex at the same time. Had that signature (not sure if signature or not but ive noticed it in two other sea dyke teas ive tried) ""sea dyke rubbery roast"" taste going on, ashy-cigar texture at the back of the throat, fruitiness and a bit of sourness among many other things!! 

Have not had much wu yi rock tea but this tea fits right in there with the category flavour wise for me! Definetly one i will be revisiting sometime soon, and im hoping the spent leaves will cold brew interestingly.

Perhaps while hot, the heat masked the bitterness, and I didn't pick up on it.

I am another green tea drinker (and oolong less frequently), I drink it every day.  
Mostly using the western style to brew it, I have also read about Gongfu style but I lack the delicate teas and the teaware to consistently use it.  
A friend told me of this method of brewing, I know there are a lot of methods out there but I was curious if the community also used it. They told me that instead of brewing for 3 minutes straight (that's what I'm using) I should be brewing for 2 minutes for the first steep and then 3 more steeps for 20 seconds each and then put together all the tea from each steeping together. The final volume for both tea methods is the same.   
It runs counter to what I am used to, namely that when you use a multiple steeping style you start small like 20-30 seconds, and then add 30 seconds to each new steeping but I also suspect that there won't be any taste differences between the western style and this method.

1663,tea,"How to preserve tea leaves is an issue that must be faced for tea lovers. Today I share some of my experiences.

**Green Tea**

Green tea is the most perishable of all teas, which causes the tea to change color and lose its flavor. Home storage of green tea is recommended in a large, dry coffee canister, sealed with plastic wrap and placed in the refrigerator. The emphasis is on low temperature, avoiding sunlight, and sealing.

**Black and Oolong Teas**

Black and oolong teas do not spoil easily and can be stored simply. Because they age and deteriorate slowly, they can be stored for long periods of time as long as they avoid light, high temperatures, and items with offensive odors. It is recommended to keep them sealed if the environment has high humidity.

**White Tea**

White tea is stored in a similar way to green tea, sealed and stored in the refrigerator.

**Yellow tea**

Pay attention to sealing and avoiding light, you can pound the plaster, lay it on the bottom of the box, pad it with two layers of paper, divide the tea into small packages, put them on top of the paper and seal the lid of the box. But pay attention to replace the plaster in due course.

**Pu'er tea**

The storage method of Pu-erh tea is quite different from other categories. It does not need to be sealed because in a ventilated environment, Pu-erh tea can continue to ferment when in contact with air, and the longer it is stored, the stronger the aroma. It is recommended to be stored in clay pots in a ventilated and dry place.

For tea cakes that are about to be consumed, you can break them into loose tea and put them in the clay pot for best results after half a month.

&amp;#x200B;

**To sum up**: the elements of tea storage are light avoidance, dryness, no odor, and sealing in addition to pu-erh tea.

Be sure to pay attention to the absence of odor. Because tea is similar to activated carbon, it has a strong adsorption effect, and if there is an odor, the taste of tea will change.

1673,tea,"Sorry for the length of the post, but I'm in a weird mood today. Melancholy and curiosity. 

I'm a total noob when it comes to tea. I'm an American slob, and it's definitely not part of the sphere of education I was given. I make amazing coffee, I can make an excellent cup using an old military surplus canteen cup over a fire. Tea, it feels like a sort of mystical realm of sorts where I don't really belong yet. Still, I begin. 

I bought a kettle. I've seen the scorn over ""stupid Americans"" (of which I am) microwaving water. No, no, a job worth doing is worth doing right. Found one cheap, a ""collapsible model"" on that jungle website, enough to get me started. Being brutally honest, didn't wanna go too fancy or spendy in case I didn't like it. I didn't want $400 invested in this to discover I don't like tea all that much. 

I will say, even with the kettle, I presume anyone used to ""proper English tea"" would be appalled. Fair enough. I'm okay with probably ending up with my own stylized rendition. 

I've a box of Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime that I'll be getting into tonight (recommended by a lady in Walmart, I'm that much of a noob), and to ""christen"" the kettle I brewed up a mug of the last bag of English Breakfast in the house. My mom was into tea a bit, but...I'm a backwoods redneck/white trash/blue collar, steeped in toxic masculinity and stupidity, I showed no interest then. 

Now, at 36 and having lost my mom to illness...I'm curious. 

Poured water in the mug to get my measurement in the kettle. My mug is 12oz, 355 milliliters. Poured it in the kettle. I hate waste, so I like to be precise. Boiled the water, put the bag of tea in the mug with the string over the side, put in a teaspoon of sugar. Water came to boil, I poured it in, steamed the blithering bejesus out of my hand, but got 'er done. Mr. Internet said steep 4-5 minutes, I opted for five; I figured since I only had the one bag with that much water, it'd be weakling stuff, so a minute extra wouldn't kill me. 

Not bad. It's obviously weak, as I suspect the bag was ""tuned"" for literally half the water volume. TBH, there's a ""proper"" teacup around here somewhere, but that's a bit too fancy for me. Like I said, I'm Redneck, White trash, Blue collar, the colors of 'Murrica, so my configuration will always be ""rustic"" at best. 

I don't really know what I was expecting to be honest, but the takeaway is ""It's not actively bad...so this is maybe an option. Help cut back on the coffee chugging and maybe explore new tastes."" So far, it tastes pretty good, no awful aftertaste or bitterness. If it's all I had, I could survive with it. I favor sweetness over other tastes and I could have gone a bit more aggressive with the sugar, but the balance it has works; I can still taste the tea itself. 

Questions; 

Am I on the proper track? 

I'm assuming two bags of most teas since I'm using an overlarge mug? 

Is my order of operations good, or should cup be filled with hot water and then tea/sugar added? Does it make any difference? 

I'm dirt poor and Walmart is the easiest place to buy tea, though I could order online. Any tea recommendations? Any pieces of kit you'd consider ""must have"" for a beginner who has a kettle, a mug, and a spoon?

**West Lake Longjing**

In the ""Tea Classic"" written by Lu Yu in the Tang Dynasty, there is a record that ""Hangzhou and the two temples of Qian Tang Tianzhu and Lingyin produce tea"". The meaning of this sentence is that in Hangzhou, Qiantang area of the Tianzhu Temple, Lingyin Temple tea is produced. This indicates that Longjing tea has appeared since the Tang Dynasty. And ""Longjing"" called tea name began in the Song Dynasty, to the Qing Dynasty to really make a name for themselves. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, four times to the Longjing tea area to taste Longjing tea, and will be Hu Gong Temple in front of the 18 tea trees sealed as the ""Royal Tea"". Since then, Longjing tea began to become famous. Until today, these 18 tea trees are still producing tea every day, but the number is scarce and expensive, so it is difficult to get.

Longjing is a fried green tea, characterized by a light taste and strong tea flavor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anxi Tieguanyin**

Tieguanyin is native to Xiping Town, Anxi County, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, which is both the name of the tea and the name of the tea tree species. After brewing, it has a natural orchid fragrance, pure and strong taste and long-lasting aroma, and high quality Tieguanyin can be brewed more than 7 times. According to the production process, the finished Tieguanyin can be roughly divided into three major types: clear, strong, and aged.

Clear aroma Tieguanyin: Clear aroma type is lighter in taste, slightly sweet on the tongue, and favors the modern craft method, which has the largest share in the market. Clear aroma Tieguanyin has bright green color, clear soup and rich aroma.

Strong aroma type Tieguanyin: Strong aroma type has a mellow taste, relatively heavy sweetness, and is a product of the traditional process of frying tea leaves after roasting and reprocessing. It has the characteristics of ""fragrant, strong, mellow and sweet"", with golden soup color, pure aroma and thick taste.

Aged Tieguanyin: Aged Tieguanyin is also called old tea or ripe tea, which is made from strong aroma or clear aroma Tieguanyin after long time storage and repeated reprocessing, and is also semi-fermented tea. It has the characteristics of ""thick, mellow, moist and soft"", and its characteristics and taste are close to that of Pu-erh tea, black tea and black tea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Huangshan Mao Feng**

Huangshan Mao Feng is produced in the area of Huangshan (Huizhou) in Anhui Province, so it is also called Hui tea. It was created by Xie Yuda Tea House during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. Every year in April, during the period of Qingming, the young buds of high quality tea tree ""Huangshan"" and ""Huangshan big-leaf"" are selected and hand-fried, the tea is slightly curled in shape, resembling bird's tongue, green with yellow, silver hairs showing, and with golden fish leaves (commonly known as gold flakes). Because the new tea white hair phi body, shape pointed, and fresh leaves from the peak of Huangshan, so the tea named Huangshan Mao Feng. The ""golden piece"" and ""ivory color"" are the two main characteristics of Huangshan Mao Feng.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wuyi rock tea**

Wuyi rock tea is a traditional Chinese tea, a kind of oolong tea. It is produced in the Wuyi Mountains in northern Fujian Province, where the tea trees grow in the rock crevices. Wuyi rock tea has the advantages of the fragrance of green tea and the sweetness of black tea, and is a high-quality type of Chinese oolong tea. The morphological characteristics of Wuyi rock tea are the twisted ends of the leaves, resembling the head of a dragonfly.

Wuyi rock tea is divided into two categories according to the varieties of tea trees: famous trees and traditional trees. Among the rock teas, Da Hong Pao, White Rooibos, Ti Luohan and Shui Jin Gui are the most famous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yunnan Pu'er Tea**

Pu-erh tea is mainly produced in Xishuangbanna, Lincang and Pu-erh areas of Yunnan Province. It is a loose tea and tightly pressed tea made of Yunnan large-leaf species sun-blue maocha as raw material and processed through fermentation. Pu-erh tea, just like life, tastes bitter and astringent when it is immature; as time goes by, its nature becomes deeper, not only the taste is lubricated, but also the taste is mellow. Throughout the ages, Pu-erh tea, with its unique Yunnan, peculiar production and mellow flavor, has attracted tea lovers from all over the world. Pu-erh tea is the most famous and noble of Chinese teas. It started to enter the palace since the early Qing Dynasty, and its history of tribute continued until the end of the Qing Dynasty, prevailing in the Qing Palace for more than 200 years.

Pu-erh tea is divided into raw and ripe tea, and the more it ages, the better it smells is the most important feature of Pu-erh tea. After brewing, pu-erh tea has a brownish red color, bright red soup, high and persistent aroma, unique fragrance, and strong and mellow taste. Contrary to the law of value of other teas, Pu-erh tea becomes more expensive as it ages and appreciates slowly with time, so some high quality Pu-erh tea is also collected by tea lovers. Top quality Pu-erh tea is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars per kilo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liuan Gua pian**

It was known as ""Lu Zhou Liu An Tea"" in the Tang Dynasty and ""Liu An Gua Pian"" from the Ming Dynasty. It is named because the tea leaves resemble melon seeds, with natural spreading, slightly curved leaf edge, green color, uniform size, no bud tip, clear and bright soup color, and green and bright leaf base.

Among all the teas in China, Lu'an Gua Pian is the only tea without buds and stems, made from a single raw leaf. The buds are removed not only to maintain the shape of a single piece, but also without the taste of grass; the stems have been lignified during the production process, and their removal ensures that the tea tastes strong but not bitter, fragrant but not astringent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Xinyang Maojian**

Xinyang Mao Jian, also known as Yu Mao Feng, is one of the top ten famous teas in China and one of the famous specialties in Henan Province. It is named ""Mao Jian"" because of the shape of its tea leaves, and ""Xinyang Mao Jian"" because of its origin in Xinyang. In 1915, Xinyang Mao Jian was awarded the gold medal at the Panama World Expo with Guizhou Maotai, and is known as the ""King of Green Tea"" and is one of the best quality green teas.

The color, aroma, taste and shape of Xinyang Mao Jian have unique personality, its color is bright, clean and free from impurities, its aroma is elegant and fresh, its taste is fresh, mellow and sweet, and its appearance is uniform, bright green and lustrous, with obvious white hairs. After brewing, the aroma is high and persistent, the taste is rich and mellow, the sweetness is rejuvenating, and the soup color is bright and clear. The proportion of top-grade Mao Jian one bud and one leaf first spread is more than 85%; the first grade Mao Jian is mainly one bud and one leaf, and the normal buds and leaves account for more than 80%; it is required not to pick the stems, not to pick fresh leaves.

**Junshan Silver Needle (YinZhen)**

As early as 2,000 years ago, Hunan was already a famous tea producing place in China.

While I’ve always had my suspicions with the idea of the British introducing tea to India, considering both Indias proximity to China and how Indians generally use the same word for tea “Cha”, I’m still a little ambivalent. Regardless I think the thread is fascinating. Although, unfortunately, the colonial aspects and the lost history is tragic.

I mentioned this set in a recent post about gaiwans for hiking, and one question popped up that I was curious about myself:  wouldn't a metal gaiwan get very hot to use, even a titanium one?

It turns out that no, this is actually one of the coolest-handling gaiwans I've ever tried.  Although the sides of the gaiwan and cups are pretty thin they are actually double-walled.  I tried brew after brew of near-boiling water to make a shou pu-erh and the sides of the gaiwan and cup were still cool to the touch!  The finial of the lid and rim of the gaiwan were only moderately warm at most, certainly not unpleasantly hot.

And of course, being titanium, the set is ridiculously lightweight.  Even after a number of sessions it still surprises me to pick up the empty gaiwan and feel almost no weight at all.  Even with water is it noticeably lighter than any gaiwan in my collection no matter how thin the walls.

I'd say the only downside of this set is that the ""form-fitting"" carrying case is actually a generic case obviously intended for a variety of different contents.  The gaiwan and cups fit very loosely inside it.  I'm tempted to order a couple more cups to fill it out a bit more, or add padding and a filter.  There's certainly no danger of breakage though from the contents rattling about loose.

So if you've been tempted to try out a titanium set, I have to say I would recommend them.",Titanium travel gaiwan set review

The development of tea has gone through thousands of years of history, and the tea making process has been progressing. To this day, there are many ways to divide Chinese teas, and it is recognized that according to the production method and the degree of tea polyphenol oxidation (fermentation), they can be divided into six categories: green tea (unfermented), white tea (slightly fermented), yellow tea (lightly fermented), qing tea (also called oolong tea, semi-fermented), dark tea (post-fermented), and black tea (fully fermented). The appearance gradually changes from green to yellow-green, yellow, green-brown, dark green, and black, and the tea broth also gradually changes from green to yellow-green, yellow, green-brown, and reddish-brown. In addition to these six categories, there is actually a category of re-processed flower tea, for the division of this type of tea, there is still controversy in the tea industry. Your own home in the office can also be casual DIY flower tea, especially the female machine friend is very necessary to drink more flower tea, the health benefits. As of now there are more than 1000 types of tea categories on the market.

&amp;#x200B;

# Green tea

It is a drink made by taking the new leaves or buds of the tea tree (the raw materials of tea are buds, leaves and stems, look at the leaves under the tree if you don't understand), without fermentation, by the process of killing, shaping, drying and so on. The color of the finished product and the brewed tea broth preserve more of the freshness of the tea leaves. Regular consumption of green tea can prevent cancer, reduce fat and weight loss, and reduce the nicotine damage suffered by smokers. Green tea is made in many parts of China, unlike white tea or pu-erh, which are only available in certain regions. Some of the more famous green teas are Xihu Longjing, Biluochun, Xinyang Maojian, Liu'an Guaqi, Mengding Ganlu, Huangshan Maofeng

**Classification**

Fried green tea: Biluochun, West Lake Longjing, Yuhua tea, Xinyang Mao Jian, Ganlu, Mei tea, Zhu tea, fine fried green, pine needles, etc.

Roasted green tea: ordinary roasted green, fine roasted green, etc.

Sun-dried green tea: Dianqing, Sichuanqing, Shaanxiqing, etc.

Steamed green tea: yulu, sencha, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# White tea

The raw materials of white tea are leaves, buds, or both leaves, buds and stems. It is micro-fermented tea, which is processed after picking, without being killed or twisted, but only after drying in the sun or by civil fire. The shape is relatively complete, the soup color is yellow-green and clear, and the taste is light and sweet. The basic process includes withering, roasting (or shade drying), picking, re-firing and other processes. The advantage of sun-blue tea is that it maintains the original clear flavor of the tea leaves. Withering is the key process to form the quality of white tea. The main production areas are in Fuding, Zhenghe, Songxi, Jianyang, Fujian and Jinggu, Yunnan.

**Classification**

White bud tea: mainly refers to silver needles, etc. (named because the finished tea is mostly buds, covered with white hairs, like silver and snow)

White leaf tea: mainly refers to white peony, gongmei, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# Yellow tea

It belongs to the light fermented tea category, the processing process is similar to green tea, but before or after the drying process, add a ""smothering yellow"" process to promote the oxidation of its polyphenol chlorophyll and other substances. The production process is as follows: fresh leaves are killed and twisted - smothered yellow and dried. The most important process is to smother yellow, which is the key to forming the characteristics of yellow tea. The main practice is to wrap the tea leaves with paper after killing and twisting, or pile them up and cover them with wet cloth for several minutes or hours, so as to promote the non-enzymatic automatic oxidation of tea billets under the action of water and heat, forming yellow color. The process of smothering yellow is not as simple as it seems to the eye, and the whole process fails if it is not controlled properly.

**Classification**

Yellow bud tea: including Junshan silver needle, Mengding yellow bud, Huoshan yellow tooth, etc.

Yellow small tea: including Wenzhou yellow soup, Ya'an yellow tea, Beigang Mao Jian, Quancheng green, Weishan Mao Jian, etc.

Oolong tea is a unique tea in China, mainly produced in northern Fujian, southern Fujian, Guangdong and Taiwan provinces, with a small amount produced in Sichuan and Hunan provinces. Oolong tea's pharmacological effects, highlighted in the decomposition of fat, weight loss and bodybuilding, the Japanese believe that this tea has a beauty effect.

**Classification**

Northern Fujian oolong: Wuyi rock tea - Da Hong Pao, Shui Xian, cinnamon, half-day waist, Qilan, Baxian, etc., but also some Jianou Jian Yang and other real estate tea, such as short oolong

Taiwan oolong: frozen top oolong, oriental beauty, packet species, Alishan high mountain tea (Alishan green heart oolong tea, golden day tea, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

# Dark tea

Dark tea is a post-fermented tea, because the appearance of the finished tea is black, so the name. The main production areas are Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Anhui, etc. Traditional dark tea is made from high maturity black wool tea, which is the main raw material for pressing tightly pressed tea. The black wool tea making process generally includes four processes of killing, kneading, stacking and drying. The following dark teas are more famous dark teas, the raw material for making dark tea is Maocha, in ancient times the nobles drank buds or leaves, Maocha is less preferred. Tibetan areas, Inner Mongolia, they eat more meat, less fresh vegetables, do not drink tea will kill people, so tea is an important material for them, but they tea and do not produce tea, so in ancient times can only and the rulers of the Central Plains to exchange or rob. Ancient traffic inconvenience, the original tea raw materials in general, tea back to them, the wind and sun led to post-fermentation (in fact, a bit spoiled) they feel better to drink, but scientific research shows that after fermentation, the tea beneficial substances increased.

&amp;#x200B;

# Black tea

It is a fully fermented tea, English is Black tea, more popular in the West. Black tea in the processing process occurred in the tea polyphenol enzymatic oxidation as the center of the chemical reaction, the chemical composition of the fresh leaves change more, the tea polyphenol reduced by more than 90%, the production of new components such as theaflavin, theaflavin, aroma substances than the fresh leaves increased significantly. Therefore, black tea has the characteristics of red soup, red leaves and sweet and mellow taste.

Dark tea, on the other hand, is ""fermented with foreign microorganisms"", through a series of processes of killing, kneading, stacking and drying to make, its fermentation time needs to be very long, so that the color of its leaves becomes black-brown, which is also the origin of the name of black tea.

A couple months ago I went to a teahouse overseas and tried the best ""English"" tea of my life. The description on the menu called it ""Harrod's Queen's Diamond Jubilee Blend,"" with the words ""darjeeling, rose buds"" next to it. I wrote it down because it matched my tastes perfectly in hopes that I would later be able to order it online to drink again. Cut to me, weeks later, on here writing a reddit post out of desperation because apparently that Harrod's tea was from 1952-2012 (therefore discontinued) and the best bet of getting it is to buy it at auctions - where it last sold for \~$200, wildly out of my budget. (I genuinely have no clue how the teahouse I went to happened to just casually have this tea in stock, but my guess is that they had a lot of stock from before it was discontinued and was able to keep it preserved?)

I don't know if anyone has tried the Queen's Diamond Jubilee blend from Harrod's before and remembers the taste or if the idea that it was a darjeeling tea with a distinct rose bud taste is helpful, but I would love to be able to find a similar tea (that is hopefully affordable).

I browsed through a very large number of posts and found that you guys are interested in Chinese tea culture, so in the last few days I have made a few posts sharing about traditional Chinese tea culture. I'm so thankful that people like what I share, and within 2 days I got over 1000karma (I don't know what the karma is for, but I'm very excited)

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1: Preheat the clay pot. Put the clay pot into the fire or charcoal to heat for 3-5 minutes

Step 2: Remove the clay pot and put in the dry tea (without adding water). At this time the clay pot has a very high temperature, shake the pot to make the dry tea evenly heated and the residual moisture in the tea will dry further. You will smell a very strong tea aroma. This step only takes a few dozen seconds. This step is known as roasting or frying.

Step 3: Add hot water. Because both the pot and the dry tea have a very high temperature at this point, the water will boil without heating the pot

Step 4: Drink the tea

Note: If someone tries this method, the clay pot will be very hot, so take precautions. The time in the steps will also change depending on the way the heating is not used, based on the actual situation

1861,tea,,anyone know what tea cup this is? where it's from? what it says?
1863,tea,"I know that this post might be somewhat controversial, bit I am also interested in generating discussion around seasoning Yixing and other unglazed clay in teaware. I will state beforehand that I own many unglazed Yixing and Tokoname ware teapots and use them frequently, but only for aesthetic purposes. As a bit of background I have a bachelor’s in chemical engineering and I am currently working on a PhD in the same field. However, instead of writing an academically rigorous post, I would instead like to paint an intuitive picture of some of the theoretical principles that would potentially govern the “seasoning” of a Yixing or other clay teapot, and to help illustrate why I am personally skeptical of claims that fully seasoning Yixing will drastically alter or improve the flavor of tea. However, you are free to disagree, as the actual chemical kinetics of brewing tea are in fact extremely complicated due to the complexity of the chemical components of tea leaves, as well as the effect of the temperature of the water, infusion time, etc. Furthermore, to make this post for a general audience, I will not be citing complicated equations. In fact I will not use any math at all, just concepts that many freshmen or sophomore chemistry students will learn with their general coursework. For these reasons, I will not assert this post as absolute scientific truth, only a hypothesis, and so I will leave it to you to make your own conclusions.

Now, many tea vendors and enthusiasts will define “seasoning” as a slow process where tea deposits become absorbed by small pores in the surface of the clay, and eventually when the tea deposits build up enough, it will have a pronounced effect on the flavor of tea. This phenomenon is an example of what is known as “mass transfer”. In fact the process of brewing tea is also an example of mass transfer. Mass transfer is governed by what chemists call a “driving force”, and for mass transfer this driving force is concentration. In solution, things will always go from high concentration to low concentration. After all, when we put a teabag in water, we find that the tea always leaves the teabag and diffuses into water, but we’ve never seen a teabag which will go into a cup of tea and spontaneously suck all the tea back up into the teabag.

However, this is not the full story, as there is one more component we need to account for, the concentration gradient, or how large the difference in concentration is. This is why brewing tea western style takes several minutes and brewing gongfu takes seconds, less tea in more water will diffuse slower than more leaves in less water, because the concentration gradient in the gongfu case is larger.

Now we can talk about clay. In an unglazed clay teapot, the pores in the surface of the clay act as “binding sites” where the molecules in the tea can stick to the clay. We know that “seasoning” clay, the rate at which the tea is deposited on the clay, is rather slow. That could mean several things, including the concentration gradient being relatively small, and clay being hard to “bind” to, and it is likely a combination of both of these and additional factors. However, it will eventually reach a point where there is a significant buildup of residue from many many tea steepings. We could say that the pot has reached a sort of maximum capacity for how much tea deposits it can hold.

So now that our pot is seasoned, how will it change the taste of the tea? Well tea is of course comprised of many different chemicals and both the concentration and the ratio of these chemicals is also important. So to change the taste of the tea we either need to change the concentration of the chemicals or the ratio in which the chemicals appear in the final brew.

Here is where I become skeptical of the exact extent in which the seasoning of a pot will change the flavor. The first reason is that in order for the seasoning to change the variables of concentration and ratio of chemicals in the tea, it has to release some of the deposited chemicals “stuck” to the clay. Since the diffusion of chemicals onto the clay is already slow, it is very possible that the diffusion of chemicals coming off of the clay surface could be a similar speed, and therefore even if you brew tea on a timescale of even a few minutes, barely anything will diffuse off the surface of the clay. Now suppose we say that the tea diffuses very fast once it is properly seasoned, then at some point the net rate of diffusion of deposits into the tea is much higher than the rate which the tea builds up in the clay. This means that overtime the seasoning will actually diminish or vanish entirely and the teapot will revert to an unseasoned state.

Another issue goes back to the “driving force” of the mass transfer. When we brewed tea in a brand new Yixing pot, there is no tea stuck to the clay, so it will diffuse into the clay relatively fast, but as time goes on the concentration of tea in the clay becomes larger, lowering the total overall difference in concentration and therefore slowing down the deposits of tea in the clay. But if we want the diffusion of tea deposits to come off of the clay, we need to have a *lower* concentration of tea in the water than on the walls, which could be difficult to achieve because the tea leaves themselves release comparably high levels of chemicals into the water. There is a bit of a workaround to this that is known as “dynamic equilibrium”, which very simply states that old tea deposits leave the clay and are replaced by new deposits replace the ones that left. However, this begs the question on if any significant quantities of old tea deposits left the clay in a single brew. Personally, I wouldn’t be surprised if the deposits only add a few micrograms of material or so to the brew, whereas most of the flavoring compounds are on a 10-100 milligram scale in about a cup of water.

Finally, it could be possible for the seasoning to change the ratio of chemicals in the brew and not affect the actual concentrations as much. Then we get into a topic known as “selectivity”, which means that some chemicals will stick to the clay and others will not. I am not as familiar with selectively binding surfaces, but overall I rather doubt that clay will have a high selectivity because it is an amalgam of dozens of different minerals, and typically engineered surfaces with high selectivity often have very specific compositions and ratios of chemicals in their composition, however I will admit that it could also be entirely possible that clay does end up being selective to certain proteins, amino acids, and other biologics.

With that being said, I am still not completely resistant to the idea that seasoning affects flavor, but I believe that brewing parameters such as dry weight of leaf, temperature, brew time, and even confirmation bias could very well play a larger role in determining the taste of your tea. However, I am interested in learning others’ perspectives on this, and there could easily have been obvious ideas I have missed.

Now, this was not the only tea in my newest order BUT all the other teas were from the current 2022 harvest and they are all really good. The only one that was lousy was the old stale laoshan green from last year. 

So anyway, I complain about it nicely. I don't feel like I was being rude or anything. But I wasn't going to pay for 100 grams of stale laoshan green pine needles when it was perfectly fine just a couple months before that. They took it offensively, refunded me the amount for the laoshan pine needles, told me not to order again, and then blocked my access to all 3 sites. At least I used up most of my rewards points on my last order. Joke is on them. As if I can't make another account on a VPN and have tea sent to a a friend's house and pick it up. Honestly it's quite immature for a company that has more than 6 million in revenue. 

I was told that I shouldn't have expected a 2021 harvest to still be fresh. Um, I'm not a tea expert but I was expecting it to be the same as it was just couple months prior. You're telling me that a tea that had great hui gan and flavor, after only 2 months, goes stale and tastes like water? Um, sorry, but what I got in my most recent order was from the bottom of the barrel. What I got in march was much better quality. There should at least be a disclaimer about older harvests tasting like shit or at least not even bother selling it.",Yunnan Sourcing is NOT to be trusted!

When I first opened the package, strong chocolatey smell. Even though it smells good, I was looking for a little more smokiness/earthy smell.

I brewed 5 grams with just under boiling water (~100C), 5 steeps in 30 sec intervals starting at 1 minute. Captured in a fairness cup and poured a cup for tasting with the root.

The taste came lighter than expected, not chocolatey though. The color was great, very dark. No real hints of smokiness/earthy tones. Made up for it with a light sweetness and almost nutty flavor. Mouthfeel was very smooth, again, a little bit on the light side, but I think I know why it's like this.

According to the description, it's not exactly the best for gong fu unless I use more grams. The directions say 100 degrees celsius, 3 grams of tea for every 5 ounces of water. Maybe that explains the lighter taste.

Overall:
Pretty good, will probably use more grams for a gong fu session later to tease out a darker and more complex taste.",TenRen 1st Grade Yunnan pu-erh

A bit of back story: I just started a [blog](https://www.sipscollection.com) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmbgMgGKUbJNBR9862JiTpw/featured) called SipsCollection, I know it's pretty empty but it's because I just started. Anyways, I was researching into Guafengzhai (刮风寨) for a blog post and video idea. If you don't know, Guafengzhai is a very famous and remote village in Yiwu (易武) which produces tea that commands a very high price each year. In Guafengzhai, there are three main areas that contain Gushu (古树), or ancient tea trees, which are Chawangshu (茶王树), Chaping (茶坪), and Baishahe (白沙河), with Chawangshu (lit. Tea king tree) being the most famous and revered. 

As I was researching, I talked to a farmer who lives in Yiwu which produces Pu-erh harvested from Guafengzhai, specifically Chawangshu. Her family focuses on Gushu (古树) or ancient tree material, and harvests from different places in Yiwu. After talking to her and interviewing her for a while, she offered me two tea cakes from her private collection. These cakes are 2019 Chawangshu Guafengzhai Gushu Raw Pu-erhs. 

Here's the thing, 1kg of this 2019 tea costs 8000rmb (US$1184), she was kind enough to reduce the price to 6800rmb (US$1006) per kg, which is the price of the 2022 tea. This means that a cake (200g) worth of tea costs around US$201, which is honestly one of the best bargains I've ever found. It's quite hard to find 2022 Chawangshu small tree tea, let alone 2019 Chawangshu ancient tea tree, and a quick search shows that western-facing retail (there was only like two sources) of 2022 Chawangshu Gushu puer costs \~US$330. I definitely couldn't pass up this opportunity. I'll list the tea's information:

&amp;#x200B;

* Origin: Chawangshu, Guafengzhai, Yiwu, Yunnan
* Date of picking: Pre-Qingming 2019 (Before 5th April)
* Varietal: Yunnan Da Ye Zhong (云南大叶种), 100% Ancient tree material

All these media are courtesy of the farmer.

So, down to the group buy. I am just a broke teen and spending this much money on these tea cakes is a financially bad idea. So, I though of setting up a group buy. There's 400g of tea in total, and I can split it into 50g or 25g. 25g of this tea would cost around US$25, but the fee will likely be more, with an estimate of US$40+ after shipping, repacking and stuff. I can ship anywhere in the world, and each person in the group buy will pay for their portion of the tea, an even portion of the packaging costs, and for their own shipping and tax costs. I can coordinate the group buy, if ya'll are up to it! I'll declare it here first: I'm not making any money from this and the farmer is not paying me anything for setting this up, I'm setting this up mostly because I'm too broke to justify purchasing one, let alone two of these cakes lmao (for the skeptics).

If you want to participate in the group buy, just drop me a reddit dm! It's by a first come first serve basis, and I will probably cap it around 15 max.

Often times, when I make pu'erh tea, I often use only very little water because the second steeping allows for a very concentrated/ strong in color in a very short period of time. 

So after I pour out the little bit of tea, I dilute it with greater volume of water to make the tea the desirable color and then drink it. 

Would this process of only brewing a little, and then diluting the tea with water, make the flavor of the tea any different than the original ways of brewing?

I’m about to attempt making a tea infusion with ginger and orange peel and have a few questions. I would so appreciate any comments/advice! 

I’m going to try cold brewing the infusion. I mostly am curious to know if anyone has any insight as far as how long storing a big pitcher of cold brewed ginger and orange peel tea would last? I’m planning on putting lime juice, coriander seeds, vanilla, and eucalyptus leaves in the drink as well (in case this affects storage time). Does it need to be sealed in an airtight container? 

Also, is it better to let the orange peels dry out before infusing? I can’t see this mattering much in the end as it will be steeping overnight.

In addition to my first post with a couple of questions I do have another tea related question that I need advice on. Since i feel like this one deserve a separate discussion I felt like opening another post. 
Here is the deal:

Buying tea always makes me feel like i am being scammed. There seems to be a lot of fake / low quality tea around. And no way to test the quality before hand. Especially outside China &amp; online. It feels like the only truly good tea I ever managed to get my hands on was either being gifted by chinese friends or in a supermarket in China (more quality control I assume). 

Long story short: Where can I buy high quality tea outside China? Any suggestions for European online shops? Or do you shop from chinese online shops directly? Will be a hefty extra charge i assume?

However, wouldn't the oil just seep into the other paper and then into the tea anyway?",Any advice on making Earl Grey? Methods of infusing with bergamot oil?

Green tea with ginger:there is nothing better than ginger, it tastes refreshing I also want to advise to have ginger tea alone without other herbal additives or other tea especially in the winter and if you suffer from a sore throat or cough

Chamomile tea, pukka night time tea:These are two completely different teas, but they provide the same bad experience no matter how you try to prepare them differently

It tastes not strong it looks like it's just water and adding a little sugar makes it worse it looks like you're drinking sugary water،but I would prefer to give Baiyong tea a chance in the future, but with another brand

2160,tea,"I’ve been trying to get into sheng puerh for a while now. Been a fan of shu for a long time and aged white has been a favorite also but I could never get into sheng. Always way too bitter compared to what I enjoy. 

That is until today. I’ve always eyeballed the amount of tea I need to break off of a cake and with shu and white tea that’s been fine since they’re very forgiving teas. An hour ago I decided to try returning to sheng again so I pried off a bit of my 2021 impressions cake and tossed it into the gaiwan. But I used about 2/3s of what I usually put in. 

Let me tell you, instead of the heavy bitterness I used to get I got a sugary sweetness with grassy vegetal notes. It was delicious. I guess it really does come down to ratios with it. The water was the perfect temp and i didn’t overestimate the amount of tea needed. I’ll definitely be returning to sheng more often now I think knowing that I just need to use less than I think I need.",Finally had an epiphany with Sheng

2162,tea,"Before buying this sampler set, I scoured the internet for other people who've tried it before, and I didn't really find any! There are the reviews on YS's website but they aren't super comprehensive and could be biased etc, so I decided I should do my own!

So here's the short answer: Yes! It's absolutely worth it! Whether you're just getting into (loose leaf) tea or looking to broaden your horizons, this is a fantastic way to do it. 

The selection seems to be a good representative of all the headlining types of tea: a raw puerh, a ripe puerh, black, green, white, and 3 various types of oolongs. No duds, and I found the price was super reasonable especially because it helped me find some new teas I absolutely love. 

Even if you're unsure after looking at the tea list, I think you should pull the trigger. I thought the same thing - I didn't think I'd *love* any of these teas, but I've even found some new favourites! 

&amp;#x200B;

I brewed everything gong-fu style with the recommended times and temperatures from the website.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's [the list of teas](https://yunnansourcing.com/en-ca/products/starter-pack?_pos=1&amp;_sid=656386185&amp;_ss=r) and my personal reviews:

* 2020 Impression raw puerh cake - 6.25/10 - honey, miso, asperagus, bittersweet, light floral, tobacco, lemon zest, vanilla, mild chocolate, boiled leaves, dank cupboard. After trying a bunch of different raw puerhs, I found out that this type of tea isn't really for me. This was probably the best raw I've tasted so far though. It was worth a try and I'm sure lots of people will like it!
* 2021 Cozy ripe puerh cake - 7.5/10 - rum raisin, dried fruits, bookshelves, light roast coffee. The thickness and dark color of this tea really surprised me! (not to mention the lack of significant bitterness) Coffee drinkers will surely like this one. 
* Black Gold Bi Luo Chun black tea - 8/10 - chocolate, brown sugar, malty, honey, chestnut. Make sure to do instant infusions if you don't want it very strong! This tea will definitely hold up to tons of milk and sugar, so this is a perfect breakfast daily drinker. 
* Green Spring Snail Bi Luo Chun green tea - 8.25/10 - fresh and nutty (chestnut), graham cracker, vegetal, umami, light floral, lightly bittersweet. Probably everything I'd want out of a green tea. Very solid. 
* Fuding ""Guo Xiang"" Gong Mei White Tea Cake - 9/10 - peaches, fresh floral honeycomb (very prominent!), allspice. This is actually one of the first white teas that I've really enjoyed, it's aged and caked though, so it's a lot stronger and brews thickly. 
* Fancy Tie Guan Yin of Anxi Iron Goddess Oolong Tea of Fujian - 9.5/10 apricot, umami, super floral (rose water), super sweet, passionfruit, fresh cocoa pods? This one is fantastic!! It's hard to imagine it's a) unscented and b) not the highest grade of this type of tea. It stands up to jasmine tea in terms of florals, and it's sweet like nectar. 
* Charcoal Roasted Gan De Village Tie Guan Yin Oolong Tea of Anxi - 10/10 - Wow! light smokiness, roast, brown sugar, rye bread, caramel, creamy!!(as if there's a shot of cream added), chocolate. This tea really spoke to me as it reminded me of the hot chocolate and campfires, and the sweet spicey dew of the morning while camping. 
*  Wu Yi Shan ""Classic Rou Gui"" Rock Oolong Tea - 8.25/10 - fruit and chocolate, sweet and sour, rum, lychee, spicey (cinnamon?), medium roast, light chocolate bitterness. I also really love this tea, but it paled in comparison to the other oolongs on this list. I might have to give it another go!

But oh no, they had proper sencha they said. So I ordered it with my sushi. They come out with a small kettle and everything. But I almost burned my hand grabbing the handle which instantly set my up for disappointment. The tea was very bitter to put it kindly.

For once it didn't feel like I was getting scammed ordering a tea, but it was unfortunately not properly prepared. Granted, I live in a Nordic country so many here have limited experience with Japanese green tea. Just made me really sad. Sadly, I am Swedish so I can't complain at the restaurant so I did it here instead. 

I was never picky with teas until I tried real Japanese green teas. I wish I could go back to Lipton, but I really, really enjoy Asian teas. I never thought tea would be my one expensive hobby.

It tastes much better at room temperature or even much colder. Is that just me or the tea, or other factors?

So far I have tried linden tea and black tea. With adding just a little sugar to the black tea (and honey for the linden tea) I like both of them.

I’ve tried a few different oolongs, blacks, a green or two here and there, but my favorite so far has been Paris from Harney and Sons.

My wife didn’t enjoy any teas except for night time teas until recently and has really taken a liking to my Paris tea.

The way I have been brewing it for a couple of years now is in an electric kettle and then steeping the loose leaves in an in mug infuser and brewing about 8-10 oz at a time.

What I would really like to do is start brewing loose leaf a pot at a time and pouring my wife and I both a mug from one pot.

I’ve really wanted to try a Yixing pot, but don’t want to spend the money on one and also they seem more geared toward Gong Fu style brewing and I don’t think I have the patience for Gong Fu and don’t want to have to pour multiple cups to get my fill.

So I guess what I’m asking for is recommendations for the best method for brewing loose leaf tea for my wife and I to share that involves a brewing pot instead of a mug infuser.

Also maybe some recommendations on some oolongs to try that are similar to Paris and maybe some night time loose leafs that aren’t so chamomile forward?

Long story short, I got very sick a few years ago because of a severe concussion I sustained from a car accident where the car basically exploded. I would get lightheaded and dizzy and feel like passing out frequently, with minimal understanding of any triggers to this day. 

I developed food anxiety during that sickness in fear that certain foods were making me feel worse, and during that, I became averse to drinking herbal teas.

I have always loved teas of all kinds and used to love finding new blends from all over the place (I used to travel a lot), but now when I want to try a new tea with any kind of herbal ingredient like elder flower or calendula, I get paranoid that they will make me feel “weird” like how I was when I was sick. 

Can anyone here help me overcome this? Share with me what teas you drink, what ingredients are in there and how they make you feel, and help my anxiety understand that it’s all okay.

Fast forward to a few months ago and a friend sent me some samples of tea from her shop, including this [Bon Voyage French Earl Grey tea](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX3UGxqacAA31sG?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900) from Seven Seas Tea. Even when I suspect I won't like something, I don't like to throw things away without giving them a chance, so recently I begrudgingly brewed this tea... and found that I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure if my tastes have changed or if it was just a different formula (this one tasted more citrusy compared to the other ones I tried back in the day, which seemed to be more floral), but I'd definitely like to have more.

Unfortunately my friend doesn't carry this tea or any similar ones anymore and the only place I can find it is on the Seven Seas website, which seems a bit expensive at $14 (plus postage) for 80 grams.

I’m not here to diss YS and their teas as I really love most of their teas, especially their dianhongs, but this tea threw me off guard.

I brewed 90-95°C for 6g/100ml of tea. It smelled quite decent, floral with a hint of citrus, just like spring time. However, the taste was far off from any other TGYs or Anxi Oolongs that I had. It tasted like sour dirty water, bland yet unpleasant in a sense. I kept giving a go at another steep since I thought maybe it was me and my brewing method but it just got worse. I stopped at steep 7 because I really felt like throwing up. The tea leaves do look really pretty though haha

It was something that I never really had happen with the tea I bought before. Even the 5-7 year old Taiwanese high mountain oolong had more and better flavour even though it was at the back of my cupboard for so long.

2631,tea,Sometimes I go through a phase where I wanna brew 4 different ways  To try out different temp and time I switched to using glass and fusor I was wondering if the tea bag affects the flavor Compared to glass I know most people will say it needs room to expand I bought some paper ones that are large sized if it has room to expand does it taste the same.  Another question is if you concentrate tea to double or triple strength and dilute can you tell a diffrence?,can you tell diffrence from teabag loose leaf vs loose leaf with glass infuser?

2633,tea,"So after reading the comments on my last post, I’ve decided to go ahead get a tea set and tea kettle, and went ahead and purchased some Darjeeling and Oolong tea from VahDam on Amazon, since I heard this was a good company and those were some good teas to start with as a beginner. For future reference, I just wanna know where you all buy your teas so I can check them out as well. Loose leaf preferably, but tea bags are okay. I heard Buddha tea bag teas were really high quality, anyone have any experience with that brand?

I would like to make something similar to this, as it is hard for me to find exactly what I want.

I have started looking at plain white teas to start with, but am having trouble choosing. The way some of the white teas are described, I am not sure which to pick that would match that.

Various suppliers have had some lackluster stuff this year which is surprising as I've enjoyed multiple teas from these same US based organic companies throughout the years. Some have been flavorless or even awful, which was surprising. Some were teas I had bags of from previous years that were superb but not good this time around. Wondering if the farmers have had it rough this season or perhaps the shipping issues going on in the world have hindered the quality because of improper storage or long transit times to the US from the sources. I'm actually thinking about going through Yunomi and the like for some teas this month instead to see if the quality is better directly from the source and to see if it's just these companies lately.",Anyone else notice quality drop is 2022 harvest teas?

2746,tea,"Hey y’all! How’s it going? Today we’re going to be looking at an aged white tea, which is arguably my favorite tea. Now I’m not new to reviewing, but I am new to reviewing tea. So with that out of the way, let’s look at some basic info! 

Price: $39.00 per 357g cake. Averaging out to $0.11 per gram when rounding up to the nearest penny. 

Harvest: August 2015. Compressed in 2017. Aged until 2020 when it was released. 

Purchased from Yunnan Sourcing. 

________________________________________

Preparation: 

I began with putting about 7g into a 100ml gaiwan with boiling water and letting it sit for 10 seconds as a rinse. 

**okay okay, enough of the prep time and info I can get from the website, how was the tea on first infusion?**

I’m getting to that. Wow, so impatient. 

First infusion was for 20 seconds and it resulted in a pale gold yellow liquor. Thick and viscous. Almost stout like in mouthfeel. 

Flavor from this was slightly nutty with notes of vanilla and honey. Not a lot of spice from this which surprised me. I’m used to my aged white tea being a little spicy. This has it but it’s very subtle and understated. 

Second infusion opened up a lot of the honeyed vanilla while dialing back the nuttiness. This continued until the fourth infusion where it started dying off a bit. It wasn’t until the fifth that it started muting. 

**typical white tea it sounds like, eh? What are your final thoughts on this though Anx?**

Yeah, typical is kinda what I get from this. It doesn’t wow me at all but it’s a very solid aged white tea that shows you what a white tea can be. It’s not bad in any way really. Just kinda boring compared to others I’ve enjoyed. 

For its price, it’s not the cheapest out there but it’s not super super expensive either. I think for starting out into the journey of white tea it’s a very solid start. It’s tasty and inoffensive. 

But you can find better and less expensive cakes to start out with I think. And that’s the thing. It’s not bad but it’s very basic. There are other, better, aged white teas out there I feel that are less expensive. This isn’t bad exactly but if you’re looking to just start out I don’t think you’ll wanna shell out almost $40 just to try. This averages out to about $0.70 per session which isn’t bad. Under $1.00 per session is about average in my book with under $0.50 being a good bargain session. 

________________________________________

So there you have it. A good, if slightly boring, aged white tea. Worth trying at the very least if you like white tea but nothing to write home about. Hope you liked it, I’m a little rusty since I haven’t written a review of anything in ages and I haven’t done one for tea before.

2748,tea,"Almost 10 years ago I made friends with a Chinese exchange student who gifted me a delicious Chinese black tea that had been infused with some kind of tree blossom.

I tried drinking the jasmine tea just by itself but it was nothing special, just warm water with a slightly different taste. I tried three steeps, and while the third steep had a little more flavor, it didn't taste like anything but slightly bitter leaf water. The same thing happens with rose and chamomile tea. I don't like the taste of honey, which is why I usually use sugar instead, but due to certain health reasons, I wanna try and cut down on my sugar and still enjoy tea and get the benefits from it. I am also wanting to purchase a tea set for just myself, but don't wanna invest until I can see if I can get past the tea's bitter taste without sugar, as I add quite a bit of sugar to my tea so it isn't so biter. Does anyone else have an alternative or tips on how to get past the bitter taste? any steeping advice? currently, I just boil water, pour it into my cup, and use my steel spoon tea strainer to mix in the loose-leaf tea with the water, and then add a few tablespoons of sugar.",How do I start to drink tea without sugar?

2776,tea,"Greetings! I have always liked tea but have only recently been brewing loose leaf myself. First I managed to acquire a Breville One Touch Teamaker for $150 locally (they normally go for $300 now) off of craigslist since I wanted something that I could basically set and forget, and I liked the idea of keeping a larger quantity of tea on hand that I could keep sipping on all morning. However up until now I have mainly been using it for black teas which I rarely did more than one infusion. However just recently I tried using it to brew some Genmaicha I purchased from Den's Tea and thought it was absolutely phenomenal. Up until now I have had green tea at restaurants or from bottles and was pretty stunned by how different it tasted in that was much less bitter, a bit like warm cereal mixed with a light vegetable broth. However I realized that there were some major limitations with using the Breville teamaker for brewing this stuff just for myself, namely that (1) It doesn't automatically infuse for less than 30 seconds (which is important because the 2nd infusion is just 15 seconds when following Den's recommended brewing instructions) and more importantly its minimum brewing volume is 500 mL, meaning if I infuse again right afterwards I am essentially consuming a full liter in a single drinking session, which is just overkill. 500 mL equates to two servings and with both infusions i find that the 2nd serving tastes noticeably different than the first with the roasted flavors from the rice being stronger in the first serving and the vegetal notes being way more pronounced in the 2nd serving. I am guessing this is why many japanese green tea preparations call for alternating pours between each cup if your serving size is more than one cup.

Thus, given that I want to do at least two infusions daily and don't want to use multiple teacups just to serve myself, I am thinking it would be better to get a substantially smaller teapot for brewing Japanese green teas just for myself. Now I am looking at many different sizes and types of kyusu teapots but am finding the number of options I have a bit overwhelming. Given my above use case (about 8 fl oz / ~250 mL of tea per infusion), I am not sure what the optimal teapot volume would be. Right now I am leaning on this 300 mL Hario glass kyusu (https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Cha-Kyusu-Maru-700ml/dp/B000NVMC4I?th=1) that I have seen recommended on this sub a few times.",Single japanese green tea drinker seeking teapot recommendations

2788,tea,"I'm a basic tea drinker - usually just black sweet tea. I've just recently learned the mouth feel after drinking tea is from tannins binding to the protein in saliva - a feeling I've always had my whole life, but just ignored. Astringent was a new word for me, but equates to the dry mouth or even pucker feel after drinking tea (or wine or eating chocolate). 

I've found articles talking about changing the way you brew your tea or to eat/drink high fat/protein items (like milk, cheese, or salami) simultaneously to give the tannins something else to bind with. However, I drink my tea mostly from our local H-Tea-O store (already brewed) so I can't change the brew process. Also I don't always want to eat/drink something else with my tea. 

I don't mind the effect so much until I'm done drinking my 24 or 32 ounce tea. I'm wondering if there is a recovery process from tannin mouth feel after the fact perhaps you have found to fix this side effect of tea drinking. Any ideas?",How to reduce tannin mouth feel after drinking tea?

I've checked the shop recommendation list/map in the sidebar with moderate success. This is what I found so far.

1. Twinings sell [2nd Flush Darjeeling](https://twinings.co.uk/products/2nd-flush-darjeeling). Has anyone tried it? Is it good?
2. I found [this](https://www.postcardteas.com/site/product/autumn-darjeeling/) on postcardteas.com. Autumn Flush I believe is 3rd Flush, but I've also found it [here](https://www.pekoetea.co.uk/products/gopaldhara-china-muscatel-second-flush-darjeeling) on pekoetea.co.uk and the URL states ""second-flush"".
3. Also found [this](https://www.pekoetea.co.uk/products/gopaldhara-red-thunder-gold-autumn-flush-darjeeling-tea-ftgfop1) on pekoetea.co.uk, where the URL doesn't mention second flush, but pekoetea.co.uk has shops in Edinburgh AFAIK.

I'd appreciate some thoughts on the above and perhaps recommendations on other shops if you know any in London. And what do you think of the three flushes, have you tried them?

I know lots of coffee/tea drinkers who get to the point where they can’t think or function without their morning cup.

This month I decided to break out of my boring old water and get some herbal tea packets. One of them was blueberry. It was okay, but way to strong in the water, so I had the idea of using the steam wand at my work and try some milk tea instead. The first time went well! The milk got a purple tint, and it tasted like sweet berries and foam, though it was way too hot. So the second time I did the same thing in a bigger cup with less heat (140 degrees) and perhaps too much foam. I could hardly taste the tea packet at all. The milk stayed white and I just had a cup of hot milk with occasional sips of sweet berry. 

So what gives? Does the milk need to be crazy hot to seep the tea bag? Should I put it in hit water first then pour hot milk on top of it? Should I have made the milk less foamy?

3033,tea,"In the mid 2000’s and up until maybe 2015 Stash had a jasmine green tea that had strong flavor and a strong aroma of jasmine flowers. It was just the regular teabags. Now they no longer taste like this at all and have a weak flavor in general in the times I have tried it since. I ended up buying their loose leaf tea and for a while that tasted like the way it used to up until a couple years ago, then it stopped. Now it tastes odd and no scent. 

I started to try other brands and this time stuck to loose leaf, such as from the tea spot, at first it was similar, then became inconsistent, and now I found a brand of pearls from a brand called FGO. I felt like this one at first tasted like how the Jasmine used to taste like, like it was close, but now it doesn’t and also doesn’t have the same aroma. 

It’s starting to make me wonder if jasmine tea wasn’t supposed to be so strong scented and flavored? But I absolutely love it like that. I read reviews and people say they love the Jasmine in many brands, including supermarket brands which taste like plain green tea to me, like twinnings and bigelow. In reviews people mention loving the Jasmine flavor though, but I don’t notice it at all.

3048,tea,"Hey Guys, first time i just tried rock tea, rou gui to be exact. I’m new to Chinese tea and just exploring and was not sure what to expect. I’m also a red wine drinker, i have zero issues explaining what im tasting, i also make my own wine from different grapes and juices. I have a hard time explaining how a tea tastes though.

At any rate, when I first tried the rock tea i was expecting something sweet and cinnamon like which is misleading. Instead what i got was a potent flavour i cant describe and somewhat like charcoal. Granted I should have tossed the first brew as this supposed to have been the wash, i forgot to do this (im new to this). At any rate im not sure what im tasting, i guess i can taste the cinnamon but without the sweetness. As the steepings went on, the flavour was more tolerable and less offensive. I seem to be tasting a vegetal flavour with a very subtle sweet after taste that lingers. When i first tried it i was shocked and didnt like it, though as the steepings went on i started to enjoy it more. I’m not really tasting dried fruit but more toasted birch bark flavours with a dose of heavy minerals, and maybe some toasted rice or barley and roasted chestnuts to round it out. 

Granted this was a fairly inexpensive rock tea from felyongtea (eBay) though with 1000 99% positive reviews everyone cant be crazy. According to the seller, the tea is rated as B which is lower end. This is what i like about the seller though, they are honest with the tea quality. Their rating scale is as follows D, C, B, A, S, SS, SSS.

I guess im just used to fruity and floral oolongs that come out of Taiwan. Now im not saying i dont like the tea but it seems to be an acquired taste. It seems like a good tea to have between meals when you are hungry since its so savoury. I find dragonwell for example more savoury with its chestnut, this tea reminds me a bit of those flavours.",What Should Ruo Gui rock tea taste like? Whats so special?

Here's my review of the Cloth Grip Ruyao Easy Gaiwan With Infuser from [teaware.house](https://teaware.house). I had purchased this with the intention of moving towards a personalized, intermediate form of brewing, as I am working on finding ways to make tea a more measured, higher quality experience than it is normally. Normally I use a 24 oz (700\~ ml) Teabloom Kyoto teapot, and brew rather large, very western brews using what I've grown to consider middle of the road loose leaf, bulk tea (Harney and Sons, Ahmads, and Smiths). My experience with doing that has actually been quite fond, however I am looking at ways to bring out the quality of the tea more, and in many ways this Gaiwan certainly helped with that.   


My first observation is that the infuser it comes with is absolutely useless, feel free to set it aside. The holes in the spout are very reasonably sized, and I have no issues with relatively processed Assam from Ahmads leaking into the brew. The overall quality of it is solid, I don't have a lot of experience with ceramic teaware, however this strikes me as well built, with a very satisfyingly sleek glaze. 

However my overall experience with it over brewing around twenty or so cups has been effected by a very, very substantive issue: There is no way to safely hold it without being burned. While in theory the cloth grip should offer some protection (it does marginally), ultimately there is no way to reliably use this without the assistance of a towel or a glove. It's not something that can't be worked around, however it is something to be aware of. Unfortunately I did severely scald my hand, and burnt my index finger/thumb while trying to pour. It does seem to have an issue with spilling if you're not exceptionally careful while pouring. 

In regards to how it effects the taste in comparison to my normal use of a borosilicate, western teapot? Quite well I find! This is my first time using a more Eastern bit of teaware, and I experimented with various ratios of green and black tea, I definitely found that the brewing process just left a more varied taste rather than heavy, exaggerated singular note (I noticed from my 24 oz Teabloom pot that most Assam I have is exceptionally, if not purely, malty in nature). 

Ultimately however for my main brewing, I am going inbetween this and my previous main teapot by ordering a 12 oz version of the teapot I normally use. However, I'll still use it for some of the nicer greens I have in my collection. I really feel that it's much easier to use with the significant difference in temperature that greens are brewed at. 

I am disappointed by the questionable ergonomics, however for a $20 piece of teaware, I think it's definitely usable and I hope I can find a way to put it to regular usage.",Teaware.house Easy Gaiwan review
3098,tea,"In many countries, tea is much more than just a beverage. It’s often deeply connected with the culture and the people. The Japanese tea ceremony is about connecting on a spiritual level while in Morocco tea is served as a sign of hospitality. Discover the different traditions around this hot beverage.

**The Famous Chinese Tea Culture**

Tea has its origins in China and it therefore comes as no surprise that the Chinese tea culture is one of the most famous in the world. While tea was originally only cultivated and drunk as a herbal medicine, the monks soon started to drink it for its calming effects and peace. The Chinese tea ceremony is a blend of different philosophies: Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. It is the result of respect of nature and search for peace. Over the time, Chinese tea ceremonies went from being strictly religious activities to social and cultural activities.

One of the most famous tea ceremonies in China is the Gongfu tea ceremony. Its name — Gongfu cha — translates into “making tea with skills” and stands for the ceremonial preparation of oolong tea and serving it to guests as a sign of respect. The whole ceremony usually lasts 20–25 minutes with the last step being the actual drinking of the tea. For that, the guests hold the cup with both hands and drink it in three sips.

**Great Britain — The British and Their Afternoon Tea**

It is no secret that the British love a nice cup of tea and the British afternoon tea is one of the country’s most quintessential traditions. The typical tea time is a light meal in the afternoon. Originally, only the wealthy classes took afternoon tea, but later the middle class took up the tradition as well. It consists of delicate finger sandwiches, followed by scones with jam and cream, then finally small cakes. The tea is drunk with the above, usually an unflavored black tea with milk. Nowadays, Afternoon Tea is more of a treat for a special occasion and is often taken in a smart hotel.

Tea has always been very popular in Britain and many people have several cups a day. Workers have one, two or more tea-breaks a day. People drink tea to warm up in winter, to cool down in summer, to revive energy levels and to calm down. As you can see, tea in the UK is the beverage for any emotional situation.

**India — It’s All about Chai**

Tea is very popular in India and almost 70% of the tea produced in the country is consumed by its own people. India cultivates huge amounts of black tea such as Darjeeling and Assam but the most popular among the Indians is undoubtedly chai. Chai derives from “cha” — the Chinese word for tea — and stands for a mix of different spices steeped into what is usually black tea. The spices include cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper. Chai is an important part of Indian tea culture and whenever guests come over, chai will be served. The tea leaves are brewed first with spices and then again with milk and sugar.

Chai wallahs sell the Indian’s national drink at every street corner of the country and the most famous former chai wallah is none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chai wallahs are not only a place to buy chai tea but a place for socializing, discussing, and debating. So next time when you’re in India don’t forget to buy your chai from a chai wallah and experience India’s tea culture!npetelectric kettle is very suitable for boiling water for tea,drinking hot tea can help refresh the mind and relieve fatigue.

**The Way of Tea in Japan**

The Japanese tea ceremony chanoyu (“hot water for tea”) is a very important cultural ritual and activity around the preparation and presentation of matcha — a powdered green tea. It is much more than just a tea party — it’s about aesthetics and connecting with the guests on a spiritual level. The Japanese tea ceremony, also often referred to as “way of tea”, is very complex with the many utensils involved and its specific vocabulary.

The Japanese host usually spends weeks going over every detail to ensure the ceremony will be perfect. Every step and every movement of the ceremony is practiced during weeks. But at the most basic level, the tea ceremony in Japan is about spending time with friends. It is held in traditional tea rooms or private homes and a formal tea ceremony lasts for up to four hours.

**Tea for Every Occasion in Russia**

Tea was brought to Russia by a Mongolian ruler in the 17th century. It was traditionally drunk in the afternoon but nowadays, tea is an all-day drink. Black tea is the most common and Russian Caravan with its distinctive smoky flavor is particularly popular. Originally the tea developed its smoky flavor during the 18-month camel caravan journey from China but nowadays it is usually given its smoky flavor through fermentation.

The brewing process is an important part of Russia’s tea culture: first of all, a quantity of tea is brewed in a small ceramic pot — a samovar — and then, each person pours some of this concentrate into their cup and mixes it with hot water. Over the years, drinking tea has evolved into a social ceremony. Tea is drunk at every family celebration or get-togethers of old friends. People also sort out family issues or complete a business deal over tea. It is therefore no surprise that a Russian tea party can last for hours.",What’s Your Cup of Tea? — Tea Cultures around the World

A touch more oxidation than occurs in standard processing might have contributed to some of that aspect range.  This mentions other ""wild"" South East Asian sheng experiences a little, but doesn't get too far with guesses about whether it is plant genetics or the wild growing conditions that lead to this unique character.

I've read some studies that say that long-term caffeine intake increase adenosine receptors in brain. So, when you quit coffee, you will have more adenosine receptors for adenosine to bind to, and this means more sleepiness, fatigue and blood flow to the brain (migraine).

If, for example, I decide to drink some tea tomorrow, how many days should I wait to drink the next one so as not to negatively impact the adenosine receptors?

This question came because after a two-weeks intensive consumption of tea I suddenly stopped, and in the following days I felt very fatigued and kinda drained.

3239,tea,"[Upton Tea Imports](https://www.uptontea.com) is my current preferred tea supplier and I like them so much I thought I'd come here and say nice things about them. 

First I'm no coinsure I haven't tried a lot of tea and dealt with a lot of companies so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to. 

Their pricing seems alright I don't feel like I am paying too much, nor is it so low that you start to wonder if it's too good to be true. 

Shipping has always been prompt, orders have come in sturdy boxes protected by dissolving packing peanuts. (Seriously if you haven't seen these before they're made of starch and they just dissolve in warm water.)

Tea is either packaged in air and light proof resealable pouches, or in tins depending on what you order and quantity. The tins are good quality with tight fitting lids. 

The tea itself has been a slight bit of a mixed bag. I've ordered their Oolong sampler, Milk Oolong, Moroccan Mint, and a selection of their fruit blend black teas. I have no complaints with the first three in fact the Milk Oolong is still what I use for gongfu style brewing and the Moroccan Mint I use for iced tea. That being said the fruit teas were a disappointment, they all had a lovely scent but had an after taste that made me shudder. 

Outside of the fruit teas I give them my absolutely worthless stamp of approval and will continue to use them in the future.",Upton Tea Imports a Review

So I’m confused and I’m writing to share my confusion. 

I brewed it for almost 5 minutes in 200 ml of water, at 94 C more or less. The tasting notes recommended 300 ml at 90 C but could that change the taste THAT much?",Kandy Tea

I picked up [this tea](http://sang-mun-xbjl.squarespace.com/tea/ssug-cha) at a Korean market while I was traveling. It's from this company called Tea Collective which is fully based out of Korea and doesn't do international shipping outside of wholesale 😭. I contacted them and asked if they would be willing to send a few boxes but the only way they would do it is with an international money order, which I don't have access to right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the tea is called Ssug-cha and it's a very delicate wormwood tea, but without the bitterness because it's prepared in the same way they prepare green teas. I have never tasted anything like it. It really is the most comforting, nostalgic flavor and the wormwood base really seems to calm my stomach.

I remember having excellent green tea at a Japanese restaurant a long time ago, but I haven't had a good experience with green tea since.

I'd prefer something sweet, less bitter, and definitely light to ease into it. The umami and nutty flavor notes mentioned by some types are intriguing if they're close to chamomile. Although I can drink a cup of peppermint or sage tea every once in a while, I don't think I'd like the strong grassy notes of some green teas. I usually drown them out with honey.

I took their test and ended up with this option (https://ippodotea.com/collections/gyokuro/products/tekiro), but at $23/50g, not including taxes and shipping (I live in the US), that's a crazy price for five brewings.

I typically use 5G of tea leaves but I mostly brew for myself. Im trying to cut back on caffeine and potentially leaves as I get into more expensive teas, so basically around 3 grams. I typically shoot for 1G per 20ML, nothing crazy. What smaller size gaiwan would I be looking for? 110ml capacity which would be closer to 60ML usable with the leaves? Why can't I just use my current gaiwan and fill it up less with leaves and water?

Also I bought a travel ""easy Gaiwan"" that has a total capacity of 200ml, so maybe 150ml usable. It also comes with 5 cups and Its a nice thick ceramic. Its a great size for serving people, though large for myself. What is so bad about using an oversized gaiwan for brewing less? its nice to have gaiwans sized for two as its more versatile otherwise im buying all these different sizes. Also in the case of these travel gaiwans there is not much choice as they are all larger. 

I mean sure, I can understand using a massive tea pot for a small amount of water loosing heat to a large amount of glass as it acts as a heatsink.

3341,tea,"Hi all, as the title says I'm in quite a dilemma. I feel like I have a very different ""acceptable flavour"" profile to most people, in that up till now I have been brewing my tea in a mixed western/gongfu style. By this I mean, using \~700 ml of water with only 4-5g of tea, and brewing for \~10-20 seconds depending. I brew black tea the western style for 2-3min depending on what it is. 4min for darjeelings.

I get more than enough flavour out of these brews, and for the last 4 or so years have been a Kinto 720ml teapot (if links are allowed, this one: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M09PT88](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M09PT88)). I've burned my way through 6 of these in this time since a few have broken... 

Now I generally don't have any concerns with the teapot, except it's terrible for pouring (literally the definition of non-laminar flow) and this is annoying if nothing else. But I love it for the space it has for the tea to grow and not having to wash any metal baskets etc.

Now here's where my question comes in. When I brew tea, I then pour it into another identical teapot before my teacup (since I can get multiple cups and don't want to continue brewing for long periods). This is fine, but it's a little ugly. Also, I'll be buying some stuff to brew my tea at the office soon, and if I can find a better method for doing this I'm all ears. Gaiwan/gongfu style isn't great since I don't want to keep getting up from my desk every 10 minutes to get more water. 

So what suggestions would you have that might suit me? Looking for a replacement to the 2x teapot system in general, or just a better container for after brewing. I've also really wanted to move to a ceramic teapot for a while, but I know some can be difficult to mix teas over time since the taste lingers. Thanks!",Dilemma with teapot selection!

I am searching for a Shanlinxi High-Mountain Oloong alternative. I bought mine at a local store, but it's quite expensive. The tea I am looking for should have similar milky and buttery taste like the Shanlinxi, but must be a vegan one, so no additives etc. At my local tea-shop I pay about 35€ /37$ per 100g/3,5 OZ.  
Recently I bought an in Jin Xuan Milk Oolong Tea from AliShan at Teavivre (no additives). The milky taste is very low and there is no buttery taste at all :( Can somebody recommend a nice milky and buttery oloong with no additives which is affordable for daydrinking?",Shanlinxi High-Mountain Oloong - Alternerative?

3370,tea,"Whenever I am trying to drink iced tea (not from a bottle but self-made, of course!) without sugar I taste nearly nothing from the actual tea (additional flavour included). I guess this is because the tea is so cold that the smell can't support the taste enough as we are ""tasting"" with the smell, too. On the other hand the sugar intensifies the taste of the tea even if it is cold.

I am wondering ... Do you put sugar in your iced tea or do you limit your consumption to teas which taste good without it even in the case of iced tea? I'd suggest that the majority here don't want to use sugar in their tea but I don't know how the taste can be significant enough *without* sugar when it is icy.",Should iced tea taste good without sugar?

**The Famous Chinese Tea Culture**

Tea has its origins in China and it therefore comes as no surprise that the Chinese tea culture is one of the most famous in the world. While tea was originally only cultivated and drunk as a herbal medicine, the monks soon started to drink it for its calming effects and peace. The Chinese tea ceremony is a blend of different philosophies: Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. It is the result of respect of nature and search for peace. Over the time, Chinese tea ceremonies went from being strictly religious activities to social and cultural activities.

One of the most famous tea ceremonies in China is the Gongfu tea ceremony. Its name — Gongfu cha — translates into “making tea with skills” and stands for the ceremonial preparation of oolong tea and serving it to guests as a sign of respect. The whole ceremony usually lasts 20–25 minutes with the last step being the actual drinking of the tea. For that, the guests hold the cup with both hands and drink it in three sips.NPET electric kettle is very suitable for boiling water for tea,drinking hot tea can help refresh the mind and relieve fatigue.

**Great Britain — The British and Their Afternoon Tea**

It is no secret that the British love a nice cup of tea and the British afternoon tea is one of the country’s most quintessential traditions. The typical tea time is a light meal in the afternoon. Originally, only the wealthy classes took afternoon tea, but later the middle class took up the tradition as well. It consists of delicate finger sandwiches, followed by scones with jam and cream, then finally small cakes. The tea is drunk with the above, usually an unflavored black tea with milk. Nowadays, Afternoon Tea is more of a treat for a special occasion and is often taken in a smart hotel.

Tea has always been very popular in Britain and many people have several cups a day. Workers have one, two or more tea-breaks a day. People drink tea to warm up in winter, to cool down in summer, to revive energy levels and to calm down. As you can see, tea in the UK is the beverage for any emotional situation.

**India — It’s All about Chai**

Tea is very popular in India and almost 70% of the tea produced in the country is consumed by its own people. India cultivates huge amounts of black tea such as Darjeeling and Assam but the most popular among the Indians is undoubtedly chai. Chai derives from “cha” — the Chinese word for tea — and stands for a mix of different spices steeped into what is usually black tea. The spices include cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper. Chai is an important part of Indian tea culture and whenever guests come over, chai will be served. The tea leaves are brewed first with spices and then again with milk and sugar.

Chai wallahs sell the Indian’s national drink at every street corner of the country and the most famous former chai wallah is none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chai wallahs are not only a place to buy chai tea but a place for socializing, discussing, and debating. So next time when you’re in India don’t forget to buy your chai from a chai wallah and experience India’s tea culture!

**The Way of Tea in Japan**

The Japanese tea ceremony chanoyu (“hot water for tea”) is a very important cultural ritual and activity around the preparation and presentation of matcha — a powdered green tea. It is much more than just a tea party — it’s about aesthetics and connecting with the guests on a spiritual level. The Japanese tea ceremony, also often referred to as “way of tea”, is very complex with the many utensils involved and its specific vocabulary.

The Japanese host usually spends weeks going over every detail to ensure the ceremony will be perfect. Every step and every movement of the ceremony is practiced during weeks. But at the most basic level, the tea ceremony in Japan is about spending time with friends. It is held in traditional tea rooms or private homes and a formal tea ceremony lasts for up to four hours.

**Tea for Every Occasion in Russia**

Tea was brought to Russia by a Mongolian ruler in the 17th century. It was traditionally drunk in the afternoon but nowadays, tea is an all-day drink. Black tea is the most common and Russian Caravan with its distinctive smoky flavor is particularly popular. Originally the tea developed its smoky flavor during the 18-month camel caravan journey from China but nowadays it is usually given its smoky flavor through fermentation.

The brewing process is an important part of Russia’s tea culture: first of all, a quantity of tea is brewed in a small ceramic pot — a samovar — and then, each person pours some of this concentrate into their cup and mixes it with hot water. Over the years, drinking tea has evolved into a social ceremony. Tea is drunk at every family celebration or get-togethers of old friends. People also sort out family issues or complete a business deal over tea. It is therefore no surprise that a Russian tea party can last for hours.",What’s Your Cup of Tea? — Tea Cultures around the World

3575,tea,"I have been meaning to get into tea. I'm not a frequent caffeine drinker, but now I want to incorporate tea in my routine to improve my attention in the morning. I've gone through the FAQ and I am overwhelmed on what brewing method and tea to choose and would really appreciate any feedback.

At first I thought I'll just make cold brew iced tea once a week and store it in the fridge for the entire week. But from what I've read so far, unlike cold brew, iced coffee decreases the flavour and caffeine if stored for longer periods. I used to drink cold brew coffee once in a while so I naturally thought of going into iced tea, but I don't mind spending 10 minutes in the morning to prepare a hot cup of tea and take it with me.

I'm confused on what tea ware to choose as a beginner. These are my current options:

* [Tea Infuser Basket](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-BREW-Tea-Infuser-Basket/dp/B07GF4WYGT)
* Get a [Hario Cold Brew Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7XK1IU) and just make cold brew tea every night.

* [Carter Move Mug](https://teaforte.com/products/tea-accessories-carter-move-mug-12oz-matte-black-21124)
* Just go grandfather style.

From the various types and stores of tea out there, I don't know what to go for first. I want to get Camellia Sinensis tea instead of Herbal or Flavoured tea as I want to learn about the natural flavour of the tea. I don't have a particular flavour preference. I just want to explore options and see what I like, so I'll likely go for a sample kit if available or get small packets of multiple tea.

My main reason for choosing to get into tea is the anti-oxidants along with the caffeine. I read that Black tea has the highest amount of caffeine (but not always) compared to other teas, so I'll probably go for black tea to start with, but don't mind trying other types as well.

I have gone through multiple stores from the recommended vendor's list and the following are the ones which weren't too expensive:

I've been using a gaiwan where I used to use an infuser, though im not sure its worth the extra effort as I use to use a large stainless infuser. Though I will say the gaiwan is a necessary for darker teas that are otherwise bitter when brewed with an infuser. I also don't like brewing dragonwell loose in a tumbler as I hate choking on the leaves, I guess I buy cheap dragonwell as there are many broken leaves and pieces. I also don't like leaving the leaves in the tumbler as the caffeine Is excessive and it can also get bitter which is why I was using the stainless infuser before I got the gaiwan",Preferred Method for brewing Dragonwell

I try a cup of Chamomile (and Peppermint) Tea at 7:00pm. Bam! I manage to fall asleep and wake up at 5:30am. And I ended up making breakfast AND dinner for myself that day.

3604,tea,"I just made an iced tea version that seemed as good as any that I've ever tried, and wanted to share it.  I added ice to a mix of hot brewed sheng pu'er and chrysanthemum tea.

More specifically, I brewed about 4 grams of sheng (from Jing Mai, probably a 3 year old version) with about 4 grams of chrysanthemum, infusing in about 8 ounces of just off boiling point water for 4 minutes or so.  I mixed that with about 6 ounces worth of iced cubes, stirring in a couple of teaspoons of raw sugar first.  I made it in a plastic tea bottle, but that part doesn't seem to change much, since it would've been the same if brewed in a glass teapot, jar, or whatever else.  

I made a second infusion brewed slightly longer, then put room temperature water in that bottle with the tea and flower material and left it in the refrigerator overnight to make a third round.

This might seem like an odd theme to everyone, to people who only drink sheng pu'er hot, or to people who never drink that.  I'll drink sheng brewed hot ""grandpa style"" in related form when driving, that's just too high a proportion for drinking it undiluted.  To fill in some background, it's not expensive tea, but buying cakes would be an unfamiliar theme to many, and people on that page definitely don't usually make iced tea out of it.  I don't remember if I ever did, beyond the cold brewing theme, and I live in Bangkok, where it might make lots of sense.  Here's that tea, and a review of what I thought of it hot (just over a year ago, so it would've changed a little since):

3638,tea,"Ok so think about it. Generally speaking a tisane is an infusion of leaves, flowers, seeds, or fruit, that is not from the tea plant Camellia sinensis. these are common verieties of tisanes:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Leaf tisanes**: lemon balm, mint, lemongrass, and French verbena
* **Flower tisanes**: rose, chamomile, hibiscus, and lavender
* **Bark tisanes**: cinnamon, slippery elm, and black cherry bark
* **Root tisanes**: ginger, echinacea, and chicory
* **Fruit/berry tisane**: raspberry, blueberry, peach, and apple
* **Seed/spice tisanes**: cardamom, caraway, and fennel

(Taken from [Thespruceeats.com](https://www.thespruceeats.com/tisane-herbal-infusion-basics-766322))

&amp;#x200B;

True tisanes are mostly caffeine free, however Yerba Mate is often put in the tisane category and it has more caffeine in it than some teas setting a pressident for coffee to be included in the category.

Of course this begges the question of why tea is singled out as special or different from the rest. Why not have them all in the category of infusion and be done with it? If it’s the caffeine then why put Yerba mate in the tisane category? Perhaps part of the reason might be that we have no word that I can find for a caffeine infusion spesiffically, though it is worth noting that tisanes are supposed to historically impart some sort of benefit to the person drinking it which caffeine defenetly does.

So what are your thoughts on this take? Perhaps we should just reffer to coffees, teas, and mates as potions and be done with it?",Coffee is just a tisane with branding?

3720,tea,"I've drank caffeine for years, more recently (last 3 years), tea is my caffeine of choice. My average tea consumption is about 750mL/day of a relatively strong Japanese green tea (sencha asamushi, gyokuro, etc.), and the occasional Chinese black or oolong. I have no problem with caffeine tolerance, though I do have to stop by 1-2pm at the latest or it impacts my sleep.  


For years this thing has happened to me, where everything is fine and dandy drinking my caffeinated beverage, then suddenly one day I CANNOT tolerate it - I get intense gut distress (diarrhea, nausea, cramping, lack of appetite), dizziness/lightheadedness, exhaustion, extreme anxiety and heart palpitations, insomnia. As soon as I stop drinking tea, it goes away, but it typically forces me to take a break from caffeine for several weeks or even months at a time. When I still drank coffee, it was alot more intense of a reaction (which is why I switched to tea in the first place), but it now happens with tea as well. But after taking this extended break, one day it's magically fine again - zero of those symptoms exist, and I'll be able to resume my moderate consumption for another year or so, until it all happens again. What is this?",Does anybody experience periodic caffeine intolerance?

Today I was remembering when this covid thing started, and anybody knew anything about it in the first strains of the virus, one of the symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

1. **Drink tea**. Seems kind of obvious. I got samples of 60 different chinese teas, plus about 10 in my stash, so tasting and evaluation of each tea (color, aroma, taste, and leaves ). Some I got different qualities of the same te eg. Long Jing. When I finish the samples I'll buy japanese teas, then vietnam teas, then indian, so on.
2. **Trying new styles and ways of making tea**. Western style, gong fu, grandpa style, japanese, cold brew... Often using the same tea, so I can feel the differences between them.
3. **Learn a related language**. I chose japanese because I have friends who can speak it.
4. **Read Books**. Not skimming, but reading and annotating. I read this six books and I'm currently in the middle of  *Tea: Cultivation to Consumption* by K.C. Willson, M.N. Clifford.

* Tea: History, Terroirs, Varieties by Francois Marchand, Jasmin Desharnais, and Kevin Gascoyne

**There's the fact that there's not much in the way of tea here in Brazil**. At least that I know of. I found only a single teashop that is not selling mass market production in Brazil, and they seemed a bit more of a restaurant serving teas than an actual shop. The sellers were unable to answer my questions, and didn't seem to know much about tea. The owner wasn't there.

There's a tea school as well, unfortunately I looked at their program and it's really basic. The school seems good for someone who wants to want to start their tea journey. They have a tasting kit with about 60 different teas and infusions, but at a highly marked up price. 

The most interesting I found is that there's an **Urasenke School branch in São Paulo**. So I'm going there this weekend to see how they work.

**I registered on a short course from the Global Japanese Tea Association**, because it seemed interesting. It starts next week. And I'm eyeing their two week japanse tea master course in Japan, because it has actual field visits to the farms, factories and auction house.

**The Darjeeling Tea Research &amp; Management Association** have a certificate on tea tasting that seems interesting, but I couldn't find much more about it.

The **ITMA and World Tea Academy** have pretty websites and expensive prices. When I looked more information abou them, I found  there's quite a few people saying it's a waste of money.

I am mostly a drinker of Japanese green teas. I love that rich umami, intense aromatics, and buttery-grassy/vegetal tastes. Been recently drinking a Fukamushi sencha of Yame, an Asatsuyu varietal tamaryokucha, and some sencha varietal Shizu 7132. 

For years I have been dismissive of Chinese green teas. That is, until I tried out some Anji Bai Cha. It wasn’t even anything fancy like being picked pre-QingMing. Just one I picked up during my last Yunnan Sourcing order because of the description and photos. I always take a big whiff of my tea leaves before brewing and the smell of the dried leaves left me unimpressed. The tea leaves were not flowery fragrant like the First Flush ‘Mao Feng’ of Yunnan I also bought specifically for cold brewing. It was nothing like the powerful yet smooth pleasurable aromas emanating from my Japanese green teas.

However, I loved how it brewed with a thickness to the mouth feel and the lingering after sweetness was pleasant. Brewed gongfu with water about 80-85C in my little porcelain pot, about 100ml at a time. I remember one of the infusions was quite vegetal with no astringency, and very smooth. I absolutely loved this brew, its aroma, taste, transformation, and it changed my opinion about Chinese green tea.

3837,tea,"I'm a long time Tea drinker and am currently tea drunk. I did a quick search on this subreddit and found several past posts referencing this feeling and thought I'd share my experience/s.

Firstly, while I don't mind any tea I much prefer green tea.

The feeling of being tea drunk is nothing akin to being drunk off alcohol although you may develop (I always do)  nausea when it ""kicks in"" and a tiny bit of anxiety. The nausea doesn't last too long and the more you experience the drunkenness the easier it is to deal with, the anxiety fades away soon after. 

Once those feelings fade, I feel content, very very mildly euphoric and relaxed in the early stages I could fall asleep. Despite feeling very calm my mind is very alert, to best describe it I feel like I'm looking at the World through a fishbowl. For those who smoke marijuana, being tea drunk provides the same mental cosiness as a puff or two from a small joint but still different. The feeling is how one feels when they drink green tea (I've only been ""drunk"" from green tea) but amplified by a lot. It is a distinct feeling and when it happens you will definitely be aware of it. I believe this is because of the L-Theanine and the other compounds in the Tea, the caffeine takes a back-seat in the drunkenness as I do not feel stimulated or agitated like I would had I drunk the same amount of caffeine from coffee. During this period I have no desire to keep drinking the tea. The feeling can be lightened by eating but for the most part it is a very nice feeling that feels organic and not ""toxic"", I tend to resume drinking once the feeling starts going away. 

If you want to experience it, try it in the morning on an empty stomach but go slow, the nausea comes suddenly and can be quite nasty if you are not prepared.",Who else is tea drunk?

I am looking for an appliance that helps me in that, sometimes I really enjoy to brew with traditional methods and sometimes i just want my tea to be ready (even if i have to sacrifice a bit of quality).
I was looking for a electric kettle (Fellow Stagg) because heating up the water to a certain temp is quite time consuming… 
Then i saw the sage appliances/breville tea maker which can function also as a electric kettle with temperature control (but also can brew tea for you).
Since i can buy a refurbished tea maker for the same amount of money of the fellow stagg kettle, which one do you suggest?
I think that the stagg is just better as a kettle since you can regulate the temp with 1 Celsius degree adjustment (instead of the 5 C of the tea maker, although I don’t know if you really need to be precise with the temperature, you can cool it down easily) and it also has the gooseneck which is helpful.

3983,tea,"I love green tea. I always have. But I only really started to realize my true love for it recently.

I've been taking this ADHD medicine that you don't want to have much caffiene on. One time, I drank a 300mg energy drink, took my medicine, and went to work. I had to sit down in the lobby and call my mom (she's a nurse) because I thought I was having an actual heart attack.

So once I got on this medicine, I decided to skip coffee and drink tea. I had always made myself able to drink black coffee (I try to be healthier and drink it without sugar or creamer), but even though I could handle the taste of the bitterness, I would always grimace at the taste. A lot of my friends and family joked at me for this. ""Is the coffee good?"" Lol.

I've never been too much of a fan of black tea unless it has some sort of fruit in it, but I knew I loved green tea, so I decided to go with that.

I've felt so much better. I never grimace at the taste, and enjoy every cup. Sometimes when I need an extra boost, I steep a few more green tea bags in there. But usually not more than 4.

I've been watching my caffiene intake, and I can drink quite a lot of green tea that keeps me going throughout the day. As long as I space it out, it doesn't hurt my chest. I just love it so much! I can't wait to try more green teas from different places and explore the tea.

Of course, I do have the everyday herbal tea when it's getting time for bed.

One of my thoughts— I feel that boba tea is often made with really sweet, low-quality tea (or even just powdered mixes) and I feel this is kind of a missed opportunity. Has anyone here had experiences with actual nice teas that do well with boba? I really enjoyed doing a chai tea from TeaPigs with boba recently, with a small splash of cream, vanilla extract, and some local honey. It was much less sweet than the stuff from the boba tea shops and I really enjoyed it.

Has anyone else done nice brewed teas with boba and enjoyed it? I know this is a little bit of a cross-over as traditional boba teas follow a very common formula, but with my discovery that you can buy tapioca pearls on Amazon, I've been exploring lately.

after that I unveiled that it's actually a **hair coloring product** and someone in the chat then discovered that it's called Henna and I never heard of it...

After that some actually suggested I should drink it because after all I kinda fooled everyone because the channel is called ""guess the tea"" and not ""guess whatever this is"" lol

(I use jasmine green tea and would only use the very upper most right corner worth and it seems to do the job more than once.  Makes easily over three pints of tea.)

As far as I am aware, most people use a single tea bag and throw it away after their first use.  I knew someone who would use the same tea bag/leaves multiple times, but may add another tea bag or pinch of leaves for more flavour along the way.  During rationing people would begrudgingly use a tea bag two or three times, but it was not by choice, but by necessity.

I my self use a relative pinch of tea in a medium sauce pan and it can get dark even on second fill up of fresh water and cooking.  So over three pints of tea easily.  I assume as long as it keeps getting dark there is still more flavour and nutrition to be had.  Is this true?  Or does it get to a point where it's all colour and no substance?

4088,tea,"I just reviewed a nice tea from Gopaldhara, a second flush Darjeeling version.  It brings up some interesting background for types and inputs, some of which I'll type out here.  I had nice citrus and other fruit tones, including raspberry, with a mint aspect that's not so typical.  It was nice; all that balanced well, and was very clean and refined.

Onto the unusual background, many first and second flush versions aren't fully oxidized black teas, so calling them oolong or not depends on marketing considerations, as much as anything.  There is more to oolong than just backing off oxidation level, but it's hard to get a good feel for the entire range of all standard oolong processing to make judgements against that.  This tea was presented as bug bitten, so not unlike Taiwanese Oriental Beauty in that regard, or related to oxidation level, or prepared leaf appearance.  Evaluating that is tricky too; supposedly the insects that bit leaves only cause similar reactions in some plant types, and I have no idea how broadly that really applies.

Then in the end the final brewed version experience is really the thing.  And to me value issues are pretty high up the list in terms of concerns too; the same tea can be a good option or not worth it if it costs half as much or twice as much.  The closest version they sell to this now, a 2021 version, sells for just under $8 for 50 grams, which isn't very much for Darjeeling of this general type and quality (more the quality; finding a version like this is tricky, because they all vary).  Tea selling out of another country, in this case India, also raises final cost considerably.

If this same tea were prepared as chopped leaves the end effect would be completely different (it's relatively whole leaf).  That's a lot of what is getting mixed in related to judging Chinese teas differently; they tend to not be made using as mechanized production methods as became common for Indian and Sri Lankan teas.  More whole leaf orthodox Assam is probably more common now that for that form from Darjeeling, because lots of small producers are trying out different approaches, where Darjeeling plantations tend to be older and established.  Gopaldhara was established in 1955 but if I'm remembering right their starting point was an established plantation that went back most of an earlier century.

I guess I grown to love it because I had depressive tendencies as a teenager, so i seemed to give me the ""up"" I needed. I do have to mention that I became an avid smoker at 18, so I became chugging coffee like crazy (Nicotine seems to inhibit caffeine absorption).

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have now been nicotine and smoke free for over half a year, and I noticed that coffee just.. doesn't do it for me anymore. It leaves me anxious, jittery, seems to actually disturb my focus rather than improve it.

&amp;#x200B;

A good month ago, after a bout of anxiety and insomnia that was triggered by use of coffee, I decided it's time to stop - I do not seem to tolerate coffee as much anymore. So I went back to what was customary in our household - black tea.

&amp;#x200B;

And man.. I have fell in love. It's been a month I've been relatively coffee free (I still have it as a ""guilty pleasure"" drink like once in a couple weeks, but that's it. It's no longer a habitual drink for me) and I have come to love black tea to the point I no longer think of coffee, but crave black tea instead.  


I just love the taste of a good black tea, the kind of ""All is gonna be okay, and you're okay!"" feeling you get as opposed to ""EVERYTHING IS BURNING"" kind of feel with coffee. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been feeling so much more calm and collected ever since I made the switch, it's amazing. What I also love is that I don't seem to be able to overdo it - you can kind of drink it endlessly without any ill side effects, and no matter how late I do it - I still get a decent nights sleep. After having constant difficulty falling asleep for as long as I remember, it's so liberating to finally be able to sleep like a normal person.

&amp;#x200B;

I drink pure Sri Lankan Black Tea - no Bergamot, nothing. Just pure loose leaf black tea. There's a supermarket brand ""Zylenica"" that sells a jar of these (with a free teaspoon included!) and their teas are amazing. I do have some occasional green tea, but nothing kinda makes me as happy as black tea.

&amp;#x200B;

Best thing I have ever done for my body after sports and after quitting smoking!",I switched to Black Tea from Black Coffee

I was interested to hear someone describe matcha as not having a good flavor unless you like the taste of grass. That's not really been my experience. But recently I bought a new-to-me brand of organic culinary grade matcha. The first thing I noticed is it's not bright green like most that I've bought, it's more of a dull, earthy green. The other thing I noticed is it has a rather fishy taste. This is new to my experience. I was just sort of checking it out trying to figure what was up, and I took a whiff and it very much smelled like grass.

can someone please help me asses whether my teapot is genuine (and good quality)?
I bought it in a shop downtown and the price was low due to mechanical damage that happened to the lid (not seen on photos). My idea is to eventually get it kintsugi repaired, I know a guy who is schooled in that.
The teapot looks similar (not identical though) to the pots they use in a different local teahouse run by a trustworthy chinese owner. The material of my teapot also looks and feels simlar to the pots in the other teahouse, it feels good quality.
However I got little concerned when I looked at the stamp... I cant read Chinese, but the characters look odd on the stamp, it made me suspicious that the teapot might be fake.

The flavoring oil used is supposed to mimic milk and osmanthus, but supposedly does not contain milk itself. I don't quite trust all that, though. Further inquiries to the seller are unfortunately futile. Searching the internet, I found both unflavored and flavored tea. The flavored tea but then steamed with milk (so no oil?).

4285,tea,"Hi there everyone,
A year ago i really started to get into drinking tea, mostly for health and mood reasons. Now, it's something I very much enjoy. 

Initially I had a really nice electric kettle that I loved. Then, earlier this year, it some how got a giant crack in it's glass, and not being able to spend another $98 on a new one I opted for a stove top kettle. I also enjoy this but i do miss the temperature control that the other had.

When I would make my tea, I normally just drink it hot. I would steep it in a container and then just leave it on the counter to come back to through out the day. For a long time I would use something like this.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013Z9NY0/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_N7610QN3GMFTSG880QEJ

I can not stress enough how much I -HATE- this thing. Sure, for storing water to keep cold, it works well. My great grandma always had one in the fridge. For tea it sucks. If you're using loose leaf tea or any kinda tea bag that leaves behind particulates this thing gets all gunky and it's a pain to scrub clean. 

I got tired of it and decided to use the plastic orange juice pitcher, till i found something better, preferably made from glass. Well that time is now, because somebody melted the pitcher on the stove top. 

My kettle says it holds 3 liters, but I suspect that's if you fill it well above the fill line. That container that melted, I can't see it being anything more than 2.5 liters. I'll have to meassure how much my kettle really holds later today.  I'm looking for something that's temperature resistant glass, holds enough for my kettle, and is not a pain to clean. 

I was hoping that some kind folks here might have suggestions regarding what they like. Thank you &lt;3",What kind of pitchers do you all prefer?

I didn't know nor care what was in it, but the slightly seaweedy aroma of a freshly-opened bag reminded me of the dulse they sold at the fair. The taste, though... It always started with a fragrant, floral note with a hint of bitterness, before the maltiness smacked me in the mouth and made me growl in appreciation. It *needed* milk; you could not drink this straight or your mouth would dry up. My mother always left the teabag in her mug, but that was too much for me.

These days... well, either my tastebuds have been damaged, the suppliers have changed or the water at home's too chlorinated, but it's no longer quite as powerful. My mother, due to cutting down on the caffeine, has to drink their decaf, which is just barely acceptable. Still, every time I go back I pick up a box or three of both the Irish Breakfast and Decaf, and I'm always sad when it's gone.

4411,tea,"Hi!

Long time tea fan, now getting into more interesting / premium stuff. 

1) I have some some excellent loose leaf tea I got with a gaiwan, so naturally I want to brew it gong-fu style. Problem is that some of them have a recommendation of using amounts of water that are more than the gaiwan can hold. To get the best results, should I scale down water + tea amount proportionally, or is it better to use the recommended water + tea amounts with a bigger cup and don't use the gaiwan?

2) I have some mate (not a tea, but still). I don't have a filtered straw, or the special glass for it. The packaging recommends brewing it western style, for like 5 minutes, but reading online thats not at all how its usually drank. Worth buying a kit for it or is it pretty close already? I really like it so far. 

3) What do I do if I'm drinking a loose leaf tea that can do 12 or even more infusions, but I don't have time to drink them all, or can't share it with others? Can I just put it away, and use it the next day? Feels like being wet could cause it to become worse maybe. Store in fridge/just leave it outside/let it dry, but cover it/...?

Maybe I'm just overthinking it haha. Thanks for any help 🍵",A couple questions I didn't find answers to in the wiki

4426,tea,"I recently wrote about shifts in consumer preference related to sheng pu'er, about style and pricing changes.  This continues from that, exploring if there is an inexpensive way to have related experience, that doesn't involve spending $80 to 100 on higher quality, natural arbor sourced sheng versions (or $50 for something presented as of more modest quality, or at least better value).  

These are ""factory teas,"" less expensive and different versions / style, with tuocha a reference to the shape, compressed into a ball, or bird's nest shape really.  They don't cost much; I just saw a newer Dayi / Taetea version listed for $6 (for 100 grams), and finding somewhat aged versions for around $10-15 isn't so unusual.  Not truly aged though, which are in higher demand.  This style of tea transitions to a warmer, milder, more complex flavor and character range after about 15 years, and bitterness and astringency switch over to other flavor and feel.  This describes what it's like trying them halfway through that transition process, at 7 and 10 years old.

They wished to post a notification of a special service they are offering to those of our community that were hit by the mass disappearance of tea shipments from China (from a number of companies) on May19th, 2020.  Many people lost their shipments and some small tea companies lost significant money refunding their customers for these orders.  The disappearance was never explained by the shipping companies.

Because this technically violates the self-promotion rules of /r/tea we asked that Crimson Lotus post [this notification in the weekly Marketing Monday thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/uqtr9i/marketing_monday_may_16_2022/i94xq85/).  However, the event is set to occur on May 19th on the anniversary, so waiting for next Monday would make the notification too late.

We have compromised on posting the notification on this week’s Marketing Monday thread, but calling attention to it with this post.  This is an unusual enough offer, beneficial to many members of the /r/tea community, that we couldn’t resist working with Crimson Lotus to trumpet this event.

If you are a person who lost a tea shipment from Crimson Lotus, or ANY OTHER tea company, on May 19th, 2020, you can sign up to receive a free special sheng pu-erh cake from Crimson Lotus (plus shipping).  This is a custom blended cake labelled “519 Shanghai”.  It is also available for purchase if you did not lose a package during that unfortunate and mysterious shipping event.

I finally had the time to brew tea again and I decided to try the sample of Genmaicha I bought from Grand Tea &amp; Imports. I don't know if it's the way they display the tea in glass jars or if it's the quality of this grade of genmaicha but it tasted pretty average. I'm definitely interested in recommendations.

I found it a little nutty, as you'd expect, and surprisingly naturally sweet. I think I like it slightly more than soba because of the sweetness. My mom was much harsher but she likes her tea strong. She'll let it steep for hours.

I love peach iced tea, so the Invigorating Peach Fresh Brew Iced Tea bags sounded perfect. The box [contains ](https://imgur.com/gallery/h02ZoJH) 3 large pouches of tea that brew 2 quarts of iced tea each. The peach scent was noticeable before I even opened the box, and it's very strong through the sealed plastic bag. Chinese black tea mixed with Georgia peaches. The peach scent is very natural and mouthwatering. 

I always have a bit of trouble trying to figure out how much tea to use for a big pitcher of iced tea, so I hope these pouches will be perfect. It was $6US, and H&amp;S also carries larger quantities that are even less expensive. 

I love Darjeeling and Assam so Stanley's Blend of the two was too tempting. It was also on sale for $8.50US.

Harney and Sons has these little loose leaf samplers of a lot of their teas, usually $4US, so I bought a few. The Cherry Blossom green tea with cherry and vanilla was on sale for $3.20US. 

They sent me two free samples--Ceylon &amp; India Orange Pekoe tea bag and a silken pyramid bag of Chamomile. 

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to whisk the matcha as it's not a powder [tea looks like this](https://www.harney.com/products/white-peach-matcha?variant=39404095307847) 

I love that Harney and Sons shows photos of the tea leaves and their optimal brew. It's extremely helpful.

He would like to start laying off the Coke Zero (and Cherry Coke Zero &amp; no sugar Dr. Pepper, ect). I've told him I will gladly make him tea (probably iced tea?) to replace the soda, but now we need to find an acceptable replacement. It needs to be caffeinated. Also, he likes things on the sweeter side (I'm sure we can work down from there, but starting off too bitter will probably be a turn-off &amp; I'd like for this to be successful for him.) 

I've been buying loose leaf teas for years &amp; years so he's seen me drinking my happy green tea every day. He'd just like to see if I can help him find some types that he would like.

I am at a loss as to how to even begin to find something that has a chance of replacing the soda.

I plan on brewing in a  700mL Hario maru kyusu with a fine wire basket. My kettle is a gooseneck kettle so the water flow is restricted and not as quick as a spouted kettle. Would this impact the timing of the infusion?

When doing second, third, and fourth infusions, do you adjust the amount of water? I am seeing info about lowering the infusion time of the second pour to about half the first pour and then the third infusion is often triple the time of the second infusion.

4602,tea,,My 10 year Anniversary gift for my wife: Pewter Tea Set from Royal Selangor
4604,tea,"I’ve been a part of this sub for quite a while. Two things I see posted again and again are “where can I buy real Yixing?” And “Is this pot I got second hand real Yixing”. 

This post is an attempt to answer both of those as well clarify a lot of misconception about the craft in general. I spend most of my day authenticating and translating teapot seals and every summer I visit (not recently obviously) Dingshu town in Yixing China where the local artisans live and sell prefired pots. I feel I’m pretty knowledgeable. 

First some clarification. 

Yixing teapot refers extremely specifically to teapots constructed in a slab built (not thrown on a pottery wheel) method and of ore mined in and around the town of Yixing. This started with HuangLongShan mine and has expanded to others, then the government ceased mining operations at most sights. Pots are either fully hand made or half handmade. The names associated with this clay are ZiSha or ZiNi aka purple sand. There are many sub categories and specific types of clay such as DaHongNi but this is unimportant. Teapots made of other clay are not Yixing. Teapots that are injection mold slip casted are not Yixing. These pots will often have the name Yixing China stamped on the bottom though. 

This brings me to Yixing rule number one: If you bought a pot for less than 100USD. It’s not real sorry. This is the entry for half handmade pots. Fully handmade shoots that price up. Artist renown shoots it up more. You will not get Yixing for less than 100USD. Period. And those fancy sets with all the cups and poem on the box, those are the worst. 

Rule number two: if it doesn’t have a seal stamped on the bottom it’s not Yixing. The government controls pottery and works of registered artists are required to be stamped and their stamps are catalogued. If it just has a name carved into it or nothing it’s probably made in Taiwan or a fake cashgrab. 

Rule number three: if the pot is super ornate with carvings or nature scenes molded into it and you didn’t pay a hefty sum, it’s slip casted injection molded clay and fake.

So where can I get real Yixing? 

—Are you interested in function and want the best clay for enhancing tea without regard to it being “art” or one of a kind?

You want a vintage government backed factory pot. Ideally out of factory one during the 70s and 80s. Half handmade and have some liberties taken with craftsmanship but made of the best clay that is now no longer available. 

https://moodyguy.biz is the best for this. There are some others like “authenticYixing” but I personally trust this seller. 

—Do you not care so much about vintage or one of a kind and would like a modern pot centered in functionality made of authentic (but not factory one) clay?

Mud and leaves is the place to go they work with Chen Chunhong and his wife to ship in their half handmade pots. Good price, interviews with the craftsman, great craftsmanship.

— Do you want a work of art?

For modern but adhering to traditional standards and fully hand made on of a kind https://www.realzisha.com is the place. They video call with the nationally recognized and ranked craftsmen and have everything from rising apprentice works to master level potters. 

For modern and not adhering to traditional standards and form Yinchen studio is great. They offer some half and some fully handmade but they break a lot of rules in regard to teapot form and are like the modern art side of Yixing. 

Vintage fully handmade… sorry these are ridiculously expensive or on display in the national museum of Chinese art.

Now there are certainly other places to buy. I would strongly avoided these unless you are into the hobby and have done a good bit of research into authentication. The problem is that every other shop (Yunnan sourcing and the likes) don’t post the artist, clay type, or production method of their available pots. All the places mentioned above do, most having video interviews or videos of pots being made as well.

I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on cutting down on caffeine while still getting to enjoy tea? So far, switching to a smaller pot (a 125mL hohin, vs. my 250mL kyusu) makes me feel like I can drink enough cups of tea to be satisfied, but because the portions are smaller, it ends up being less tea overall.

I'm also looking into lower caffeine teas to substitute for my full-caffeine favourites (gyokuro, sencha asamushi, korean semi-wild).

I have enjoyed tea at tea houses and occasionally iced tea in the past. So far, though, I feel really frustrated with how weak it is coming out. I'm using about 3 times as much tea as the retailer recommends, steeping for the max recommended time, and heating water to the recommended temperature. The teas are all... nice, I guess, but they mostly taste to me like hot water with a little bit of other flavors - and very few of those flavors are what I think of as that quintessential black tea flavor.

The retailer recommends one teaspoon ""per cup"" (which I understand typically means 6 ounces in the tea world). I have a 20 ounce teapot, so I'm using 2 tablespoons, AKA 6 teaspoons. That amount expands to fill the infuser basket most or all of the way.

I've also tried adding a very small amount of sugar, but that does nothing to bring out any flavor (just makes it slightly sweet).

***Am I just not cut out for tea? Are my taste buds too weak? Any opinions or ideas are very welcome.***

These are the teas I've tried, and they were all too weak for me, though the flavors and their amount did vary between varieties:

I steeped 6 bags of tea in two cups of vodka at room temperature for 3 hours, and then added simple syrup, baking soda, and a gallon of water. I'm starting to think that steeping in alcohol was a bad idea. Perhaps it drew out a lot more caffeine than water would have.

I've always been brewing my tea in tap water boiled (or brought up to other temp) in your standard kettle, as tap water in my country is drinkable even raw (straight from tap). The taste of tea was always.. ok-ish. Could sense different notes of flavour, no chlorine taste or smell was present, overall nice experience.

Though when I drank tea in my local teashop the difference was always there. Talking about same tea cultivars from same year tasted there and in home, as they also sell the tea leaves they serve to guests. Teashop tea was always more reach and balanced. Always. I thought that they have some great know-how, since they are business. Well... turns out it probably was just water all along.

I used bottled mineral water, all other factors seemed the same to me. Tea got far more flavour, especially in those subtle notes which suddenly exploded from the infusion taste, it was overall more reach and balanced, like in tea shop.

4950,tea,"I got my second shipment of Bird &amp; Blend teas this week and have been quite amazingly impressed with every flavour.

In my first shipment I liked the teas, but none of them really wowed me. Peach Cobbler was too subtly flavoured/not very peachy, Cherry Bakewell was a bit tangy cherry, not much else, Dark Choc Chilli Chai was okay but didn't blow me away, Totally Nutty was quite good, but Bonfire Toffee (which I think is a great tea) just didn't somehow suit my tastebuds.

This time I got the following four teas:

* **Creme Egg Tea** - *Sri Lankan black tea, cocoa nibs, cocoa shells, jasmine blossom, sunflower petals, natural flavouring* - a really incredible tea that tastes like chocolate custard but is not remotely ""sickly"" or artificial, as many chocolate-flavoured teas can be. The jasmine is very subtle, I couldn't markedly detect it, but I feel it gives a slight floral hint/lift. As an experiment I brewed a cup adding a tiny bit of jasmine tea, and the extra jasmine actually didn't work, so I think they've got the balance perfect.

* **Birthday Cake** - *Rooibos (84%), Sri Lankan Black Tea, Sprinkles, Almond Pieces, Vanilla Pieces, Mallow Flowers, natural flavouring* - I'm not a huge fan of rooibos generally, but the almond in this really brings it together and it's an exceptionally smooth cup and much like Yorkshire Biscuit Tea, is somehow ""savoury"" rather than sweet.

* **The Big Smoke** - *Chinese pu-erh tea, ginger, lemongrass, lapsang souchong black tea, red peppercorns* - honestly one of the most fascinating and drinkable flavoured teas I've had. It's like a savoury smoky lemon chai. I will almost certainly be ordering this one again, as well as looking for similar blends.

* **Coconut Milk Oolong** - *Taiwanese milk oolong, coconut flakes, desiccated coconut* - this one is supposed to be brewed at 80c and the first time I made it I brewed it too hot, not letting the boiled water cool enough. This made it taste like bitter green tea not even an oolong. The second time I put some cold water in the cup first and the transformation was amazing. It's so smooth. I even managed to drink a cup of it without milk and didn't hugely struggle as I usually do with black/non-milk-added tea. The only thing I wonder about is whether the coconut could be a bit stronger? So I'm going to try adding some extra coconut to a future cup to see what that does.","Review of four Bird &amp; Blend teas: Creme Egg, Birthday Cake, The Big Smoke, Coconut Milk Oolong"

While the Yogi’s family got rich, a lot of the supporters were very poor, living in squalor, and working for the cult.

I just thought Yogi tea was just one of the multiple regular tea companies on the market. I had no idea it had such a dark origin story.

I thought others would like to know and watch the episode for themselves. I have no problem with Yogis and SE Asian religions, but I do have a problem with organizations who take advantage of women and children. I thought others would like to know where their money is going. 

The people who head 3HO now deny any wrongdoing by Yogi Bhajan (even though he had multiple young wives brought up in the cult). 

There’s so many other brands out there, and it’s cool that there’s so many small independent companies we can patronize. Yogi Tea makes billions a year.",Disturbing info about Yogi Tea being owned by a cult

I'm a tea drinker and I'm planning to buy some stuff to bring tea to work. On the same occasion, I wanted to learn how to improve my preparation skills to get a better result on my beverage of choice, so in that regard I have several questions: 

\- What do I need to make good tea? I'm using tea leaves (not bags) in a cup that is made to prepare to infuse the tea, but it prevents me from making more of it or even transferring it to another recipient. So I assume that I need a kettle and something to boil the water (maybe a 2 in one?). What do you recommend in that regard? I would like something durable (lifetime would be the best) and efficient, I don't mind paying a bit extra if it's not an incoherent amount.

\- Next, the leaves. The quality is a factor but how do I recognize the good stuff from the bad one? I'm already going to a specialized shop that got a tea that smells and tastes fantastic if I compare it with basics teabags. But I don't know if it's just an ok tea or if I'm wasting my money on expensive tea that isn't worth its cost. Here's a picture of what I bought for my earl grey: [https://i.imgur.com/NWobfjh.png](https://i.imgur.com/NWobfjh.png)

\- Finally, the technique. Right now I'm not doing anything particular, I boil water, pour it into my cup (in my particular case, it's already in) then add the tea leaves and let it infuse by itself for 5 minutes. Is there anything I should do or pay attention to?

I put a larger coffee filter in the basket and then pour the loose tea in the filter and brew. It makes good enough tea for me to drink, but it's not as good as at restaurants. What am I missing? Do they just have their own special blends? What is the most important thing when brewing regular unsweet tea?

5255,tea,"hey tea ppl,

ive seen that u shouldnt make dandelion tea from dandelions in ur yard if ur yard has been sprayed w pesticides or herbicides. i have not sprayed my lawn w anything. but all my neighbors keep up their lawns very well, they are well trimmed, bright green, and uniform. they have sprayed things on their lawns in the past. im not sure if they have this year, and im not gonna ask... im worried that the dandelions on my yard might have soaked up whatever these dumases might have paid their working class friends to spray on their side of the fence. dont ppl usually spray their lawns w stuff in the spring?

should i take a dandelion plant indoors and water it and give it compost so that it has a chance to clean out whatever it might have soaked up? i know roots make good tea, in case it goes to see and i cant brew from the petals anymore.

or maybe i should pick dandelions more in the center of my lawn, farther away from my neighbors lawns?

After first trying this one out and being both major impressed with it, and naive about the whole category of so-called ""Jin Jun Mei...JJM"" \[also styled  **Jin Guanyin\]** teas, I worked through four other ones offered by YS... all JJM, which is almost but not quite all of them. There are six total with the moniker. To me, there is no big contest here. I wrote my notes on them all. From other makers and vendors, this type of tea is called by an older name.  Apparently by sometime in 2019'ish the professionals in the industry saw that the excitement of ""Jin Jun Mei"" had passed, and the market was littered with fakes \[which may have actually been serious attempts to produce a better JJM, but who could actually claim ""authenticity"" in the origin of it and process?\]. see  [https://sevencups.com/2019/07/the-east-is-red-chinas-red-black-tea-renaissance/](https://sevencups.com/2019/07/the-east-is-red-chinas-red-black-tea-renaissance/)  and [https://www.teaguardian.com/quality-varieties/tea-varieties/jin-guanyin-black-tea/](https://www.teaguardian.com/quality-varieties/tea-varieties/jin-guanyin-black-tea/)  and [https://www.valleybrooktea.com/post/black-tea-jin-jun-mei-4-common-misunderstandings-part-i](https://www.valleybrooktea.com/post/black-tea-jin-jun-mei-4-common-misunderstandings-part-i)

Nonetheless despite the intrigue and manipulation the tea I'm recommending here, whatever it might be properly called, is outstanding as a true, robust, dark, rich, complex, delicious, cup for those that like dark, somewhat 'heavy', never-disappoints black. It is not 'sweet' if the word is still at all defined in the english language. \[ adjective 1. having the pleasant taste characteristic of sugar or honey; not salt, sour, or bitter   Example: ""a cup of hot sweet tea"". I have repeatedly challenged anyone to show me a black/red that is sweet on the tongue as people once defined ""sweet""... sweet... and nobody has produced one either in blacks or ripe pu\].  In one of the articles you'll see them assert that the 'true' JJM was buds-only, and some of the YS ones do seem to be bud-heavy, but the result of them, to my senses, is pale/thin/light liquor with elusive flavor and no particularly redeeming qualities compared to other boutique-y pale bud teas.

One problem is that they tend to get crud buildup around the weld where the metal meets the mesh. 

I'd like to find something better that is easier to keep clean and possibly imparts less flavor. The problem is that the ones that are solid metal or ceramic usually have little holes instead of mesh which allows more particulates to pass which is unacceptable.

Having said all that, one of the gaiwans did have wet tea in it (it’s really dry here and it was overnight, so little chance for mold), and of course clay is porous and absorbs nearly everything. I mention this because it’s possible if any disinfectant reached this gaiwan, the wet tea would hold onto it.

As a precaution, I would like to clean these out but I’m unsure how to proceed.  Originally, I thought placing each one separately in boiling water for about 30 minutes would do the job, but I’d like to get input before I proceed.

The botanical name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which comes from the family Camellia. This is the Chinese variety; in the northeast of India, a second variety known as Camellia assamica was discovered in the nineteenth century. The tea bush has leaves with finely serrated edges, with numerous oil glands. The flowers are white and have a delicate fragrance.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Tea Colours](https://preview.redd.it/zvwhoq8lnot81.jpg?width=575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23d10cc2169048185ae3ae7151d054fe8ebe6dbf)

The cultivation of tea requires a warm, humid climate, and cultivation at higher altitudes is considered to produce tea of superior quality, although factors such as the climate, soil, method of harvest, and processing also affect the tea quality.

The majority of teas are made from young leaves. When the bush reaches the necessary maturity, leaves are picked by hand. For the highest quality teas, only the top three newest leaves are picked.

After harvesting comes to the drying process. The leaves are spread out and left to wilt until they are very malleable and can be rolled without breaking. During this process is when the leaves release the substances that give them their characteristic color and smell.

**The giant forest**

In 1939, in the province of Yunnan in the southeast of China, a huge swath of wild tea trees were discovered. Some were more than 98 feet (30 meters) high with trunks 3 feet (a meter) in diameter. Their age is estimated to be around 1,700 years old.

**Modern and classic teas**

The custom of delicately flavored teas has been around for many years; however, fruity teas are a more recent trend and are often closer to an herbal infusion. The ideal choice is always a tea with a truly natural aroma and essence, such as those shown on these pages.

[Green tea](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) is made by drying the leaves completely to avoid fermentation. It is the most common tea consumed in China and Japan. Along with white tea, it has the most proven therapeutic properties.

Green tea tends to have a more delicate and herbal aroma. It has very little theine or caffeine; depending on the variety, the quantity may be between 8 and 16 mg per cup. By comparison, a cup of espresso can easily have more than 200 mg of caffeine. Here are some of the most highly regarded varieties:

• Bancha. Alongside Sencha, although of lesser quality, it is the most common tea in Japan. Very low in theine.

• Genmaicha. Green tea with toasted rice; is frequently drunk with meals by the Japanese.

• Gunpowder. A Chinese tea with a strong flavor, which also appeals to fans of black tea. Often in the form of leaves compressed into a small ball.

• Kokeicha. Three-year tea; is very valued in Japan. It is made by toasting very fine twigs four times. Then the twigs are pulverized and pressed into fine needles.

• Kukicha. Made up of the stems of tea leaves, it makes a yellowish infusion with a distinctive flavor and very little theine.

• Lung Ching. This tea is the lung ching (“dragonwell”). It comes from the lake region of Hangzho, China. It is celebrated for its emerald color and sweet taste.

• Matcha. Powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony; yields a rich, astringent, jade-colored infusion.

• Sencha. A Japanese classic. Also available in a decaffeinated version.

Mu Tea. The so-called mu tea does not contain tea leaves; it is actually a unique mixture of sixteen plants and spices, revived in the last few decades from an ancient oriental tradition. It has a very particular taste and is wonderful for digestion. 

**Black tea**

&amp;#x200B;

[Black Tea](https://preview.redd.it/vy454dmjlot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5581839253ee765fe8c6de09adc881dfc2b9a1f)

[Black tea](http://lelow.online/black-tea/) is obtained through an oxidation process. Freshly harvested leaves are left in humid rooms so they ferment. This treatment lasts between three and five hours depending on the variety, which gives the tea its characteristic dark green or black color.

Black tea has a strong flavor—closer to coffee—and can be combined with milk. It has a higher quantity of caffeine than green tea has. Each cup contains between 25 and 100 mg, depending on the degree of fermentation.

Among the most popular varieties of black tea are:

• [Assam](https://lelow.online/product/halmari-tea-assam-ctc-buy-online-best-quality/). A full-bodied tea with a warm brown color. The Camellia assamica—a different plant than Sinensis—is grown in the northeast region of India.

• Ceilan. The ancient name for Sri Lanka is given to this delicate and aromatic black tea. It is commonly sold in bags.

• Darjeeling. Called “the champagne of teas” for its delicate fragrance and flavor. It is grown on the slopes of the Indian Himalayas. It is also sold decaffeinated.

• Earl Grey. Classic British mix of black tea with bergamot. It is one of the most commonly purchased bagged teas.

**Leaves from the sky**

The Darjeeling valley is found in the northeast region of India, on the border with Nepal. Eighty-seven tea plantations in this region have a 125-year history. The plant is grown at elevations between 1,970 and 7,050 feet (600 and 2,150 meters), on steep mountainsides that drain heavy monsoon rains.

The tea that grows in this region is of unmatched quality, a bundle of it falling somewhere between sweet grapes and ripe peaches. Between April and May the First Flush is harvested, tender young teas that produce a very light infusion. The second harvest, or Second Flush, occurs in July and August, and produces a bright infusion with a more intense flavor. This is considered ideal for after-dinner drinks.

• English Breakfast. Invented by a merchant in the nineteenth century, this is a very strong black tea to help you wake up in the morning.

• Keemun. From Chinese, “mountain of the lion.” This is a very high-quality tea grown in the humid mountains of Anhui. Its aroma is like that of an orchid.

• Kenya. Brightly colored and intensely aromatic, this is one of the black teas with the most body. It is grown at high altitudes in the African country and is usually sold as a powder.

• Lady Grey. This is a more fruity—and feminine—version of Earl Grey. In addition to bergamot it contains rose petal and orange peel.

• Lapsang souchong. This robust Chinese tea has a characteristic smoky taste, from the process of drying leaves over a wood fire.

• Samovar. A very popular mixture developed in Russia from Chinese black tea with a touch of smokiness.

• Sumatra. This is a black tea with an intense, but slightly sweet, flavor. It is grown in the Indonesian island of the same name.

**Blue tea**

This is the name sometimes given to semi-fermented teas, also called Oolong. Instead of completing the oxidation, the fermentation is stopped mid-process—usually after about two hours. The result is a tea halfway between green and black. It has a balanced flavor with a combination of the characteristics of green and black teas, and is very popular in Taiwan. The caffeine content depends on when the fermentation is interrupted and can vary from 10 to 55 mg per cup.

**Yellow tea**

The leaves of this tea are left to mature rather than ferment. These are varieties that are difficult to find commercially. Yellow tea takes its name from the color of the infusion it produces. It has a singular and defined taste that can be slightly bitter. Its fresh scent leaves the mouth clean and dry. Its flavor—somewhere between sweet and bitter—lingers on the tip of the tongue after drinking it.

Chun Shan Yin Chin is considered the best and most valuable yellow tea. Mao-chien and Huang Da Cha are other popular varieties.

**Red tea**

There is some confusion about what is popularly known as “red tea.” The Chinese give this name to Pu-erh, a variety of green tea that only grows in the Yunnan region and is fermented to darken it. This “tea of the Emperor,” so-called because it originally was reserved only for the highest offices of power, is frequently used in diets today because of its “fat-eliminating” qualities.

Sometimes “red tea” is used to refer to Rooibos, a South African plant with a sweet taste and invigorating and healing properties, which belongs to a botanical family unrelated to tea.

**White tea**

White tea is grown in many parts of China. It is lightly fermented and gives a very lightly colored infusion. In some plants, the leaf appears to have a white fuzz. The buds are harvested just two days of the year, in spring, and are picked by hand. It takes approximately 80,000 buds to produce only 250 grams of tea; this is why the price is so high.

The legend of the white tea

Popular tradition tells that in ancient China, this type of tea was harvested exclusively by maidens with gold scissors, and only the emperor had the right to taste it. The location of the sacred gardens was itself a mystery, and those few who discovered it paid with their lives. Pai Hao Yin Chin is a fairytale about this white tea.

In Fujian, there was once a drought so severe that nothing could be harvested for many seasons. Then a plague ravaged the country and many people died. The situation got worse and worse and the elders recommended they go search for a sacred plant that grew beside the well of a dragon, in a nearby mountain. The juice of this plant, they said, would bring back the land’s prosperity and cure the sick.

Many brave young people from Fujian went to the mountains in search of this sacred plant, but none of them returned, since the well was guarded by a fierce black dragon. Two brothers and their sister decided to go on the search. The oldest was the first to go, but he did not return. The second departed and suffered the same fate. Finally, the younger sister decided to go in search of her brothers and the plant. When she got there, she found that the dragon had turned the men to stone. Using her wits, she managed to steal the plant and kill the dragon with an arrow. With a few drops of the sacred plants, she brought the men back to life and they returned to the town and planted the seeds. The land became fertile once more and the sick were healed.

From that day on, all of the plants in Fujian, a province at an altitude of 6000 meters, were of white tea, which is grown there to this day.

White tea has a much softer taste and scent than the other teas, and it contains the least amount of theine: about 1 mg per cup. It is highly valued for its therapeutic properties since its antioxidant power is triple that of green tea. The most well-known varieties are Shou mei, Pai hao Yin chin, and Pai mu tan.

**Aromatic teas**

Normally these are made from lower-quality leaves. In western shops, they are most often mixed based on black tea, although there are some classics made with green tea like that jasmine—highly valued in China—or Japanese lime.

Tea gourmets always prefer the pure varieties, but if they are to consume aromatic tea, they opt for flower accents.

The fragrance of the flowers is incorporated into the leaves during processing.

It is essential to achieve the right balance between tea and flowers so the fragrance does not cover the natural flavor of the tea. According to experts, the flower should make up about 30 percent of the taste and the tea should be the other 70 percent. In and of itself, the type of flower depends on the type of tea. Teas with a stronger flavor allow for the incorporation of more concentrated fragrances.

The flowers most commonly used are jasmine, rose, lychee, and lotus.",Tea Colors - Lelow Online

“An after-dinner conversation without tea disturbs the order of the universe.” - RUDYARD KIPLING

[Tea](https://lelow.online/product/giddapahar-darjeeling-first-flush-tea/) is a legendary drink that continues to gain fans around the world. In fact, its popularity has grown so much in the last two thousand years that today the only beverage consumed more is water.

**Lu Tung, “Song of Tea”**

[Tea Song](https://preview.redd.it/4nytw5grzmt81.jpg?width=95&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df752baede0080552f016250535a96c9cea23cae)

1. The first cup moistens my lips and throat. 
2. The second cup breaks my loneliness. 
3. The third cup searches my barren entrail, but to find therein some thousand volumes of odd ideographs.
4. The fourth cup raises slight perspiration; all the wrongs of life pass out through my pores.
5. At the fifth cup, I am purified.
6. The sixth cup calls me to the realms of immortals.
7. The seventh cup–ah, but I could take no more!

I only feel the breath of the cool wind that raises in my sleeves.

Where is Paradise? Let me ride on this sweet breeze and waft away thither.

Someone \[Okakura Kakuzō\] said that tea “has not the arrogance of wine, the self-consciousness of coffee, nor the simpering innocence of cocoa.”

Whether used in an infusion, a smoothie, or in cooking, the delicious and delicate flavor of this plant can surprise even the most demanding gourmet.

[Leaves of Bliss](https://preview.redd.it/p7rawr2azmt81.jpg?width=187&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ba0d371f35cfc45b9fd6bd36183c13ff39e08a)

This treasure of health and flavor was zealously guarded by emperors for many centuries until intrepid merchants from Holland and Britain began to import it to the West.

There are many varieties of tea, defined by their origin and processing, but among all of them, green and white teas stand out for their prodigious health benefits. Their powerful antioxidant effects—and gentle stimulating properties—have been linked to the exceptional longevity of the populations in regions of China and Japan.

**A legendary origin**

The first documents that mention [***tea***](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) date back to the period between the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The inhabitants of ancient China in this period sang of the excellence of Tu, the name given to the group of plants which we now know as tea. This is the official origin, although if we give credit to popular legend, tea has been around since approximately the year 2700 BC. 

Between the years 206 BC and 221 AD, during the Han dynasty, improved methods of gathering and preparing tea leaves made tea a popular beverage of the royal family. Its prestige among the nobility grew, reaching its peak in the period of the Three Kingdoms (221–277 AD), when tea served as a substitute for wine at the court’s banquets.

**Emperor Chen Nung**

The French writer Maxence Fermine describes, in his novel Opium, the discovery of tea in China: “One day, more than four thousand years ago, the emperor Chen Nung was traveling with his guard through a distant region of his great country. As the journey was long and tiring, he ordered them to let him stop to rest in the shade of some trees to protect them from the sun. 

The convoy stopped and the emperor sat cross-legged under an unknown bush. Immediately, he asked for a bowl of boiling water, as he was thirsty and it was the best remedy he knew to quench his thirst. His servants hurried to bring it to him. At that moment, a leaf fell into the emperor’s bowl. Chen Nung drank the water without notice, and when he did a sweet yet bitter aroma filled his throat. Intrigued, he looked into the bowl and found the leaf that gave this fascinating scent and flavor. And thus tea was born.”

&amp;#x200B;

[Tea in China](https://preview.redd.it/8ey1nagmkmt81.jpg?width=302&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68925abe3a63acaa4336772540edbfbaa807131c)

 The general population would wait another five centuries before experiencing the goodness of this virtuous plant, since it wasn’t until the Tang dynasty, from 618 to 907 AD, that tea became the national beverage of China. Proof of this is that a philosopher of the time, Lu Yu, wrote the first account of its history, cultivation, and preparation in 780 AD: the Cha-Ching.”

Tea’s reputation reached every corner of China, thanks to caravans of merchants that crisscrossed the country. In 705 AD, Camellia sinensis crossed borders for the first time and was introduced in Japan by a monk named Dengyo Daishi. During this same time period, tea arrived in Tibet and was a great success. There they boiled tablets of pressed tea and then mixed it with butter and salt. It wasn’t until the start of the twentieth century that tea in the form of infusion became popular there, although there are still many Tibetans that prefer the traditional preparation.

**Tibetan style tea**

In his memoir, Seven Years in Tibet, mountain climber Heinrich Harrer (played in the movie by Brad Pitt) describes the local custom of drinking tea mixed with yak lard, a combination that he found horrifying. The author commented that some Tibetans claimed to drink more than a hundred cups a day.

**Beyond China**

Tea had begun to cross borders at the beginning of the ninth century when the first shipments arrived by boat to Korea and Japan. There, a Buddhist monk called Yesai published the first Japanese book on tea in 1191. Both countries began to cultivate tea in the humid, mountainous regions, and their inhabitants soon learned of the therapeutic properties of the infusion. Zen monks incorporated tea in their routines in the temple, in combination with meditation that lasted all day.

[Tea Collection -Black Green Burgundy white Tea](https://preview.redd.it/iqkqxzjwkmt81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbfe01e3585b52afd27e6b87f5e4704a486a063)

Regarding the union between Buddhism and tea, the legend tells that an Indian prince named Drama had decided to devote his life to prayer. Abandoning his home, he began a pilgrimage toward China and Japan. Exhausted from the hard days of journeying, he succumbed to a deep sleep along the banks of a river and slept for a long time. 

Upon waking, he felt horrified by his laziness and meted himself a severe punishment so as not to succumb to sleep again: he cut off his eyelids and buried them in the place where he had slept. Many years later, returning to his home, he passed that same place and discovered that a strange bush was growing where he had buried the eyelids. The monk chewed a few leaves and realized that they helped keep the mind awake. Since then, the Zen monks have always cultivated tea in the monastery gardens.

**From “cha” to “tea”**

The names given for the word “tea” are very similar throughout Asia: in Japan, it’s called cha, in Russia caj, in India tschaj and in China, ch’a. Some linguists maintain that it’s possible all these names come from the word for “vitality” in Chinese, chi.

In the Fukien province of China, the Dutch learned the word tay, which means “tea” in the local dialect, and this sound was introduced to Europe. In fact, in Ireland and England, it was pronounced tay until the start of the eighteenth century, after which the word was derived to tee and then tea—as we know it today.

In many European languages, the same word is used as a generic term for herbal teas or an infusion of herbs.

Apart from making the most of tea’s curative properties, the Japanese nobles also began to include tea in their social meetings. Thus was born the Cha no yu, the tea ceremony, a delicate and demanding ritual lasting several hours, for which the hosts would have expensive and precious utensils.

**Tea arrives in the West**

The first record of the existence of tea in the West dates to the year 851 AD. It was written by an Arab merchant named Suleiman in his book Relations in China and India, where he defined it as “an aromatic herb with a bitter taste that is drunk with boiled water in the East.”

Apparently, westerners did not hear about this infusion again until 1529, when the Venetian Giambattista Ramusio wrote in his book Navigazione e Viaggi about the existence of a plant in the East that “calms pain of gout and also guarantees good stomach function.” Jesuit missionaries that visited China and Japan in the sixteenth century also spoke of a plant with a sweet taste that the natives called chai.

**The East India Company**

In the seventeenth century, the European powers competed to claim the new markets in Asia. During this process, the Dutch East India Company brought the first shipment of tea to Europe in 1606. Later, the ships of the English East India Company achieved a monopoly on tea and began to distribute it in France, Germany, and Portugal as well as England. In 1657, the first teahouse opened in London, and financial transactions involving the plant took place on its upper floors. But tea became popular in England a few years later, when King Charles II married Catalina de Berganza, a great fan of the beverage.

The Portuguese princess brought with her dowry the port of Bombay, one of the most important hubs of maritime commerce between Asia and Europe, which became key in the tea trade between the two continents. The infusion began to be served in the court and, during the following century, became the most popular beverage in England, winning over even beer and gin.

In 1834, the East India Company lost its monopoly on tea after the implementation of a British governmental resolution. With free competition between companies, the speed of the ships became more important, so large ships gave way to small, lightships called clippers. This produced true competition to be the first to arrive in port and be able to sell at the best price, resulting in all kinds of incidents and adventures on the high seas, as the typical passage took about a hundred days.

The custom of adding milk to tea—so deeply entrenched in England today—was introduced by the Dutch in the early seventeenth century and then spread to France and England. The Japanese and Chinese never add milk to tea because they believe it ruins the flavor, original color, and aroma of the infusion.

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, tea was drunk at any time of day. The creation of the British afternoon tea—at five o’clock—is attributed to the Duchess of Bedford, who after drinking it in the afternoon with a snack found it so delicious she instituted the ritual with all her friends.

**The spread of tea**

In 1810 the Chinese began to cultivate tea on the island of Formosa, in modern-day Taiwan. A decade later in Assam, in the northeastern region of India, Robert Bruce and his brother discovered vast thickets of tea growing naturally and established the tea industry in the then-British colony, including the Darjeeling region.

In other parts of the world, tea arrived under more difficult circumstances. In Ceylan, modern-day Sri Lanka, the cultivation of tea began in earnest after a plague affecting coffee trees devastated all the plantations on the island—at that time it was the second-largest producer of coffee in the world.

In each country, tea has been introduced differently, with many local variations. The Maghrebis, for example, inherited tea from the English and their national drink is mint tea. It is served in a glass with a lot of sugar and accompanied by honey cakes. Proper etiquette dictates that the host should drink at least three glasses of tea, with the last one being stronger than the previous.

1. Little to no caffiene 
2. Loose leaf
3. Not expensive (25 dollars for a few ounces)

I'm not in the best spot financially but love tea and want to expand my knowledge of tea. So far I've mostly just ever had herbal from brands like celestial, stash, and Bigelow. I have found that some of these herbal teas are far too weak in flavor for me and end up just being slightly altered water. However some flavors such as Bengal Spice, or peppermint, have been absolutely wonderful when mixed into a sort of latte with milk and honey. I also really loved the decaf chai black tea from Bigelow. I am putting in an order for some earl grey and some English breakfast decaf from TheTeaKitchen and GoodlifeTea.

-	What’re some recommended matchas in the mid/everyday and ceremonial grades?

5835,tea,"Hi all,

I'm a tea newb in the sense I don't know much outside loose leaf black teas (started with chai, but I diversified to some other stuff). Outside that I don't know anything about anything. I tried a somewhat expensive bagged green tea from hmart for the first time and got a headache drinking it because it was so bad. I've had really good green tea at a japanese tea garden which I loved tho so I know its just some low quality side effect or smt.

Coming to my main questions (no need to answer all, just be like { 2) &lt;followed by your answer&gt; } ), I would like tea recs and ingredient suggestions for the following:

1) a green tea, ive had hojicha, matcha, genmaicha which i liked (have heard of longqing, gyokuro, never had though) 

2) what tea has the highest and/or most diverse antioxidants?

3) is Pu er really that good and what is butterfly pea tea, are these worth getting, are they super healthy or what?

4) if I want to just diy something and combine green tea, herbal tea, and something with a hint of spice into a coffee filter tea bag, what ingredients could I combine to create such a tea profile?

&amp;#x200B;

I know these are a lot of questions. I'm trying to do my own research but there is a lot of 'fake' info online and I would like to hope that the people here have more insight than other internet goons. I am also reading the subreddit here for info so if you have links to check or key words to tell me instead of explaining yourself, that's also appreciated!

I've jumped on the matcha train! After doing my research, I've decided to ditch coffee so I can reap all of the benefits of matcha; I am very excited!

I just received my first packed of Encha Ceremonial Grade and do, however, have a few questions.

I am used to making an cold latte in the morning in a 18oz cup. This used 2 shots of espresso, followed by filling the rest of the cup up with milk. I'd say 16oz milk.

I am wanting to replace the espresso with matcha powder, therefore, I am wondering the proportions.

I read on the Encha site to mix 1 tsp of matcha powder with 2oz of water, followed by 5-6oz of milk.

Because I still want to consume generally the same amount of milk in the morning, I am wondering if I should do 2 tsp of matcha powder with 2oz of water, followed by 16oz of milk? Or should I do 2 tsp of matcha powder with 4oz of water, followed by 14oz of milk?

Side question, I am also wondering why Encha suggests to mix the matcha powder with water first, prior to filling the cup up and mixing with milk?

I tried googling a bit, but most of what I've read is contradictory.

5980,tea,"Hey there teafolk,

TL;DR: whats a good way to keep/obtain boiling water for fresh brewed tea during a hike?

This spring I'd like to have some nature outings and take time while I'm out to have a mini tea-picnic in serene settings. There are some wonderful travel gongfu sets out there these days, but I'm wondering if there's anything out there that can really keep a container of near-boiling water for a few hours.

Lets say I boil water at home, put it in a pre-warmed vessel, travel 0.5-1.5 hours, hike for an hour, and then want to make a pu-erh to share with my friend(s) (so at least 500-700ml). 

In a typical thermos I'm skeptical that the water will remain close enough to boiling to be useful, though perhaps for a green or oolong, maybe black if the trip is on the shorter side. A video demonstration from Zojirushi shows about 40 degrees drop from boiling in 6 hours, so if we can assume linear drop, that means -20 degrees after 3hr, bringing it to about green/oolong territory

There exist car-lighter powered boilers, but I often won't be traveling in a car. [Another redditor explained why it's unlikely a USB powered kettle would exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/kp4v64/any_good_portable_electric_kettles_i_could_buy_to/ghv4gyo/) but this also assumes you're boiling water from scratch, I think it wouldn't be so bad if you were using fairly hot water like in the above scenario and using a heating element to slow the temperature drop...

Which brought me to the existence of temperature controlled travel mugs, but from what I can see these are also almost all car-powered, though a few battery powered ones are out there but they mostly top out around 140F.

Lastly there's the camping approach, but almost any fuel stove and pot to boil water will be bigger than the entire travel gongfu set, so unless I was actually camping I think this would be untenable for an enjoyable hike.

Anyone have any other ideas? Have I unfairly discounted one of the above approaches? Or does anyone have experience trying this? Maybe the tried and true thermos is ""good enough""... I know I can always lower my expectations, but if it's possible, I'd love to make it happen.",Gongfu on the go (ie hiking) - whats the best solution for boiling hot water?

since having dipped into trying different kinds and also some more ""expensive"" mixes (still from the supermarket though) i would say that i taste the difference, but i never really had a ""wow moment""

6001,tea,"Hi all,

I drink loose leaf tea almost exclusively, but bagged tea is very convenient for travel. Living in Switzerland I have found a few good brands (Sirocco, Länggasstee) that offer tea pyramids with good loose leaf tea in them, but I end up paying something like 0,60-0,80CHF (US$ 0.70-0.90) per bag that way.

In the US in the past I had bought Numi teabags in bulk pack (100 ct) which is currently about $0.35/bag. I never thought Mighty Leaf justified its price premium over Numi, FWIW.

Filling my own tea pouches would somewhat cancel the convenience of bagged tea for travel, so I am definitely looking for prepackaged bagged / pyramided teas.

Any recommendations for bagged high quality black teas (nothing exotic, it could be an ""English Breakfast"" or a ""Yunnan Golden Special"" or something like just a decent Assam, Qimen, Darjeeling, etc)?

6087,tea,"I know this isn’t generally a practice a lot of wine drinkers include in their tasting, but I have been doing it a lot lately to my enjoyment and was wondering if it’s something anyone else does or if there is anything to it. I’m relatively new to wine but I’ve been drinking it in - literally and intellectually - a lot in the past few months, and I’ve noticed that the aroma of different wines left at the bottom of the empty glass are not unpleasant, and are very different from each other and the wines that used fill the glasses. I can pick out distinct notes, and to my nose, they can broaden the wine’s flavor profile. They can even sometimes show if a winemaker was cutting corners by adding artificial flavors to a cheaper wine.

Why I even considered taking this practice semi-seriously: I also like drinking tea in the traditional Chinese style known as gongfu. A big part of enjoying your tea this way is smelling your empty cup (or gaiwan) after you have finished it. All of the antioxidants, oils, and flavor compounds are the most concentrated and fragrant when your cup is empty, and it produces a warmer, richer nose than any other way to smell tea, be it the wet leaves or the the drink itself. The name for this is bēi xiāng, and it is a fundamental part of tea tasting.

I haven’t found that wine drinkers often include this in the process of their own tasting and aside from cultural differences and practices from the east to the west, I suspect it’s because wine and tea are very different kinds of beverages, and wine oxidizes very quickly when there is a high surface area to volume ratio. That being said, the multitudes of flavor compounds are still there, only a minority of them oxidize straightaway, and the alcohol does the same evaporative legwork that a heated gaiwan does in concentrating the aroma. More importantly, in this novice’s opinion (who hardly has a grasp on any of the science behind this) the empty glass smells quite good, better than the actual wine smells in a few cases.

Background:

 I currently own two products from Teavana, 1 is the stainless steel tea basket (which has worked well but It's still hard to clean out my Thai tea, even if I clean it out right away).  Then I have their pot thing which lest you push the liquid into a mug from the bottom, but I hate this thing as it stained on it's first use and is also not the easiest to clean as particles still get stuck in the mesh...plus...IT STAINED. I  also had a ball with a chain that my mother brought home one day that was great and actually stayed clean but it broke one day. I've been drinking tea my whole life, I usually drink Green (sencha or Matcha) tea in the mornings and I'm just looking for something that won't stain and won't break.

I have been buying tea from FLT, I really like to drink Jasmine on a daily basis and usually buy a pound at a time which quite honestly doesn’t last long. 

My husband told me that SBT has Jasmine at a better price so I went and bought a pound to try. 

FLT Jasmine doesn’t seem to be just Jasmine, to be honest feels like some sort of black tea is mixed in but I am not sure.. SBT tea is way lighter in flavor and color and the loose leaf tea has some Jasmine flowers in it. Both are very fragrant but SBT is definitely more delicate and aromatic. 

Does anyone know what the difference between different qualities of jasmine is? how I can judge better where to buy from? What is your experience with these two jasmines? Any favorite place to buy jasmine from?

I'm a pretty passionate coffee guy, and have recently developed an interest in tea. I have been watching some resources on YouTube, Mei Leaf for the most part, and I have some ideas i would like to discuss with some people that know much more about tea than i do.   


So, after i had gotten my quality tea, i still wasnt happy about how the tea tasted. It was full of bitterness and left my tongue very dry, I'm assuming those are the tannins working their magic. I therefore troubleshooted my process and turned out im brewing with too much leaf for too long, and in one of those tea balls. I then watched Mei Leafs video where he showed off the \[Conniseur Tea Brewer\]([https://youtu.be/puldqGnW9P0?t=1521](https://youtu.be/puldqGnW9P0?t=1521)), and i thought ""My, oh my, that works a lot like some coffee brewers that are very popular, the \[Hario Switch\]([https://youtu.be/2sYSCqCkF6k?t=106](https://youtu.be/2sYSCqCkF6k?t=106)) (timelapse where you can see easily how it works), or the Clever Dripper. They are basically holders for a coffee filter with a valve at the bottom. You rinse your filter, put in your coffee and water and let it infuse french press style, and then you open the valve after the desired brew time to release the coffee through the paper filter and into the cup. I then thought to myself ""How is this different to what that tea brewer is doing?"", and that is where you guys come in.   


Would the Hario Switch be a viable tea brewer?   
Is filtering tea through a (pre rinsed) coffee filter a bad thing?

Do you see any overlap between tea and coffee?

Advice online seems to suggest 1 tsp tea (about 2 g) per 100 mL water.

6229,tea,"Very sad :(

So for the last two years I was an absolute tea fiend. Like, to obsessive, unhealthy levels lmao. White/green/oolong/puerh/matcha/black you name it, loved it. Drank 5 cups a day, every time I went to the supermarket would walk through the tea aisle literally just to inhale the scent; would even frequently eat the leaves, wet or dry.

Anyway, all that to say tea was a huge part of my life, and I couldn't really imagine going without it. Then January this year, contacted covid. Was very mild fortunately. During that time was only drinking water/hydralyte. Never lost my sense of smell or taste at any point (which is what I was initially worried about)-- but ever since, the one lingering effect is that I have completely lost my appetite for tea. Would even go so far as to say the thought of tea almost repels me. This goes for every type of tea. And it's not like they smell any different than before, it's just I feel my brain flicked a switch and decided not to enjoy it any more. I think I've only drunk 2 cups since January and I didn't enjoy them much at all. They were some of my favorites too (milk oolong, sencha). 

It's just so strange to me, and honestly it makes me so sad. I hope one day I can once again enjoy tea like I used to. Had this happened to anyone else?","Lost appetite for tea after COVID, anyone else with this experience?"

I thought I did it right, I ordered original black tea with tapioca bubbles. Apparently one of the most ideal combination for hot bubble tea.

The milk tea was quite good, I usually drink it plain, and even though it felt closer to hot chocolate, I enjoyed it.

The bubbles, though, ruined it. There was nothing bubbly about it, like the enjoyable fruity pop from the cold ones. It was a soft, sticky substance that I ended up swallowing whole, dreading each one. I attempted chewing it and it's just gross.

I don't know how I'm supposed to eat/drink that, I checked a guide beforehand. Meh.

I haven’t drank/made loose leaf in ages, but the other day I bought a lapsang souchong from Taylor’s of Harrogate and remembered how much I enjoy making and drinking it. 

What are some decent/entry level online sources for loose leaf tea?
I tend to brew western-style, though at some point I would be interested in getting a cheap gaiwan and taking it for a spin. At this point, I’d prefer to buy from the more budget end of the spectrum—a cheaper daily variety of teas. I’ll probably initially buy greens at my local Asian grocery, but was curious as to other possible sources (there’s not a local tea shop for hours, alas). 

What I like: Gunpowder green, Darjeeling, oolong, your basic black blends, jasmine green, lapsang souchong—stronger flavors in general. Would love to eventually experiment with more subtle flavors, but I realize that a budget buy might not have that sort of thing. 

What I dislike: Not a huge fan of white teas! Probably good because they’re more expensive",Budget loose leaf recommendations?

However I've seen videos in Japanese teahouses of people using so little water it doesn't even look like the leaves are fully wet. I've also heard people say use room temp water or even cold water.

6269,tea,"I've spent the last few weeks perfecting my iced tea method, and I wanted to share it because it is a departure from the typical iced tea approach. I find that the standard method of brewing iced tea in one huge batch and steeping it for 5 minutes or more does a disservice to the flavor of the tea, usually in the form of an overly tannic/bitter finish.  Sometimes traditionally-brewed iced tea is drinkable, but for me, iced tea made the typical way is never *great*. 

The method I'm sharing here makes a far better iced tea, and borrows its main principles from gong fu style brewing ( it uses more leaf, less water, shorter steeps). It requires more hands-on time, and it does use ***a lot more tea*** than the standard iced tea method,  but the overall amount of time it takes me to make iced tea this way is actually a bit less than the ""standard"" way and the flavor is going to be incredible. If you're someone who likes to make iced tea out of high-quality leaves, I think you'll appreciate that you're getting a more true-to-flavor beverage this way. 

This approach produces full-flavored iced tea with excellent dimension, color, and body with no bitterness. It works equally well for black, oolong, green, and white teas, and it also produces great results with flavored and scented teas.   


**Supplies:**

*To brew tea this way, you'll need:*  


1. Loose leaf tea — whatever kind of tea you like will work, just not teabags. 
2. A glass pitcher for iced tea. I use an 800mL (\~28 oz.) glass pitcher. I recommend shooting for 750mL-800mL for this method, particularly if you are using flavored or scented teas. You want to be able to fill this container with 2-3 steeps; after that, flavored tea can get a weird and bland IME. If you're brewing with pure teas, you could go bigger if  you wanted since those tend to hold up through more steeps. 
3. A 350mL-500mL teapot with strainer. You can go bigger if you want, but I very strongly recommend steeping no more than 400mL of tea at once and doing multiple steeps. Doing it this way will get you more dimension in the flavor of your finished product. I also recommend a strainer that is large enough to allow enough room for your tea leaves to open up fully.  
4. A kitchen scale 
5. An electric kettle with variable temperature settings (optional, but it does make this a lot easier)

*I have recs for the tea pitcher and the teapot w/ strainer if you need them, but I don't want to post those here so people don't mistake me for a teaware shill. And if you already own stuff that's pretty close to what I'm describing, it will work great! But if you want to know what I'm using, send me a message and I'll happily tell you.*  


**Instructions:**

1. Using the tea amounts specified below, add the leaf to your pot.
2. Heat your water to the temps specified below. Add the heated water to your pot 350mL to 400mL at a time.
3. Steep according to the time chart below based on your tea. You will need to do 2-3 steeps to fill an 800mL
4. **I do not add ice to the pitcher!** I only add ice to my glass when I'm ready to pour a glass of tea. And I always chill the tea in the fridge first. I like to make the tea the night before I plan on drinking it and chilling the tea in the fridge overnight. 

**TEA AMOUNT (per 100mL of water)**

* *I'm usually brewing around 350mL of tea at a time, so for example, if I were making green tea, I use 14g of tea leaf, which is 3.5 x 4g. If I were brewing 400mL at a time, then I would use 16g of tea.*
* *These numbers are approximate, it's okay to go a little more or less, depending on your tastes.*   


*White:*   4g

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Green:*   4g

*Oolong:*   6g

&amp;#x200B;

**STEEP TIMES (in SECONDS, not minutes!)**

* *I don't rinse my leaves before making iced tea, so I'm not including any rinse times here*
* *If you're using pearl style tea you might need to add a little time to the first steep to give the balls time to unfurl, but I admittedly haven't iced any pearl teas yet so I don't have any specific recommendations on timing for those*
* *These are the times that work best for me, but you can adjust according to your preference. But we're working with seconds, not minutes — and I promise you're going to get a full flavored tea because you're using such high ratio of leaf to water.*

Then, I read a web page that recommended brewing raw pu'erh at 190F for 3 minutes (like an oolong). (I also increase the steeping time by 30 seconds for each re-infusion.) This method is a *huge* improvement. I still don't think that I'd ever buy a cake of this stuff, but brewing it too hot definitely ruined the taste.

Apparently, you can get away with brewing ripe pu'erh at a much higher temperature, though. (Similar to a black tea.)

https://teaandspice.com/8-black-tea


My favorites are:
Windy City Irish Breakfast (best black breakfast tea I’ve ever had)
Ingredients: Assam, Nilgiri and China black teas

Siberian Delight
Ingredients:  Tippy Yunnan and Assam teas and hand-rolled jasmine infused green tea leaves (Freshwater Pearls).

Northern Estate Assam
Ingredients: Single Estate Assam Black Tea 

Yunnan Black Needle
Korakundah FOP Black Tea

Snow Buds (a white tea)
Ingredients:  Organic Snow Buds are a rare and fine white tea varietal from the high altitudes of northern Fujian, China. 

Lady Slipper Oolong
Ingredients:  Formosa Oolong. This Fanciest Grade is a rare, entirely handmade, labor-intensive top grade Oolong

I’ve tried Puerh and am not really a fan…. Too musky for me.  Roobios teas are a bit too flowery for my taste.  I tend to like more bold flavors.

Hopefully someone is familiar with it. 

So far it's been underwhelming. The tea is nowhere near as strong and rich as I am used to from tea bags.. which is contrary to this entire subreddit. Am I doing something wrong? I am brewing for about 5-10 minutes and even then I feel it lacking. I have upped the dose from one teaspoon to two teaspoons, it still doesn't give me that kick that I am after.

The bagged tea that I am comparing this to is Lyons Gold Blend which is a favourite in Ireland. As far as teabags go those are by far the best I've had. I imagined loose leaf black tea to be much richer and stronger than this. Maybe I've just got the wrong blend?

as a beginner to finer teas, I tried the Intro to Tea Set from What-Cha https://what-cha.com/products/intro-to-tea-collection. I finished most of it and contemplate my next order, I was hoping for some recommendation based on my experience with the Set.

My favorites were the Georgian Natela's Gold Standard Black tea and the Taiwan Red Oolong. I will certainly be ordering more of these two. The Honey Black Tea was also nice and while I still enjoyed the Assam, it was my least favorite of the three black teas. As far as the Oolongs are concerned, I enjoyed the more oxidized ones more than the lightly oxidized Taiwan Four Seasons, which I wouldn't have been able to distinguish from a Green Tea. I didn't like the two Green Teas very much. Finally I had a free sample of a charcoal roasted Four Seasons Oolong which I thought was nicer and more full-bodied than the regular Four Seasons Oolong.

Based on this, what teas would you recommend? I'm also open for trying some of their Whites, Yellows or Puerhs but I don't really know where they fall compared to three types I had.

I started by boiling water, then took round 10g orange peel added a teaspoon of lemon juice, then half a teaspoon of honey and finally a teaspoon/half a teaspoon of brown sugar.

After the water has been boiled I add the ingredients to the mug and pour a tiny bit of water over the top and stir, just enough so the sugar has nearly dissolved, I then add around 3cm of hot water and let it sit for about 5 - 10 minutes. 

Finally I then take out the all of the orange peel and dispose of it in the bin.

6458,tea,"Last night I made myself a cup of loose leaf Assam Gold. On a whim, I decided to add a splash of soy milk and a spoonful of sugar. As soon as I took a sip, I spat it out. It tasted SO salty. This was my first time trying a non-dairy milk in tea, so I thought that might be why it tasted so funky. I added another spoonful of sugar, gave it a taste, and it was even saltier than before. I mean salty like sea water. Absolutely undrinkable.

Today, I experimented a little. Here are my findings:

Tea on its own: tasted fine.
Soy milk on its own: tasted fine.
Sugar on its own: tasted fine.
Tea + soy milk: tasted fine.
Soy milk + sugar: tasted fine.
Tea + sugar: tasted salty.
Tea + soy milk + sugar: tasted salty.

I also tried the above experiments with a loose leaf Earl Grey, an Earl Grey tea bag, and a loose leaf Kenyan. None of them tasted salty.

So, it’s got to be the combination of the Assam tea and the sugar where things get interesting.

It had mentioned preheating all your vessels using 70° water then by the time you pour that water into your gaiwan it will cool down to the advised 50°. Point is, for fun I've been monitoring the temperatures when I steep any of my tea and despite preheating my gaiwan the temperature of the water 2 seconds after pouring it in is already 10° lower. I know the temperature will gradually decrease but should it be that low from the start? Is that factored in? If someone says 90° gives great results with a tea does that mean the water should be 90° for at least a few seconds after hitting the leaves or does 90° factor in the temperature drop. Makes me wonder if I should be preheating with much hotter water.",Advanced brewing temperature advice?
6498,tea,,Afternoon Gong Fu With Jade Oolong From Tealyra
6499,tea,"Hello all,

I'm quite a fan of black teas, and drink a lot of whole leaf teas from Yunnan particularly (mostly from Yunnan Sourcing, absolutely love what I get from them). I also regularly try new teas.

About a year ago I bought some ""Hongyu Hong Cha Ruby Nr. 18"" from a local tea shop in Switzerland (they don't have it in stock at the moment so I can't link to their web page for it). I thought it was absolutely delicious, one of my all time favorite teas - malty, rich, incredibly aromatic, with some lovely plum / plum brandy / sweet chocolate notes that were just awesome.

I'm in the US visiting family now, and ordered what I was hoping was going to be the same tea from Tealyra - [https://www.tealyra.com/loose-tea/oolong-tea/brandy-oolong-ruby-18/](https://www.tealyra.com/loose-tea/oolong-tea/brandy-oolong-ruby-18/)

The prices were similar, and it seems an obscure and fairly particularly named tea, so I thought there were good odds that it would be from the same producer or at least quite similar. The leaves look quite identical to my eye. However the tea I got from Tealyra, while perfectly decent and tasty, is nowhere near as aromatic or complex as the tea I bought in Switzerland. In both cases I'm using well filtered water, and all the other teas I typically drink are pretty equally delicious in both locations. I've played with water temp between 90-100C for the new tea, but it just seems definitely dulled, lacking the rich sweet brandy/plum/chocolate notes, and it seems less rich as well. I will take some back home with me to brew in Switzerland to see if there is something about the water. I would love for that to be the difference, but I guess it won't be.

Could the tea from Tealyra be old? Are there multiple producers of this tea? Any way of telling what the quality is going to be like buying a tea with a name like this in the future? Other suggestions / thoughts about the pretty large difference in apparent quality? In both cases the tea costs around 20 $/chf/eu for 50 grams, so it's not cheap.

6551,tea,"I just tried some of the Spring 2022 harvest green teas from YS, and I'm quite underwhelmed. I got a couple of pure buds, the Zhu Ye Qing, and the Imperial Grade Bi Luo Chun. The Bi Luo Chun at least had a nice viscous mouthfeel and some sort of flavor, but I gotta say, the others just kind of tasted like sad bitter water with a hint of hay. 

In comparison, my Zhejiang Longjing I got elsewhere is absolutely bursting with nutty, vegetal, and sweet aromas, with a thick liquor, minimal bitterness, and pronounced sweetness and umami. Granted, it was like 5x the price, but I've had some very decent cheap teas too.

6605,tea,"I'm just full of complaints lately over the teas I've purchased so I finally dug through the Yunnan Sourcing website to look for something new to shake things up. I'm sure you can imagine how reading the vague descriptors of ""floral,"" ""fruity,"" ""nutty,"" ""umami,"" and ""vegetal"" over and over started to make those words lose all meaning. Still, I think I've assembled a list of teas I might enjoy trying so I'm back here to consult the good people of reddit. 

I tend to favor herbal teas because I like those floral notes. Chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine, bergamot, lavender. I also enjoy the nuttiness and gentle almond flavor you can get from white teas though lately they all taste flavorless to me. I don't have anything against black tea or oolong. I just have less experience with the good ones. I tend to drink black tea or earl grey for a little caffeine and with lots of milk and sugar. With oolong, I just drink whatever someone hands me. As for what I dislike, I don't do well with strong blends, but I think that has less to do with the strength of the tea and more to do with the blend. Dried fruit is especially headache-inducing for me.

I like having teas with baked goods and desserts so it would be great to find something complementary. If I could find a tea to cut through enough that I could brew it all day and have it with meals, that would be even better. Anyway, here is my current list that I'm looking to narrow down...

We don't have much preference for bags vs loose leaf, but it's hard to find stuff that is in compostable bags that isn't also wrapped in something non-compostable (looking at you Bigelow). I don't mind loose leaf, but have yet to find something real cheap for a multi cup a day drinker. I like Republic of Tea's offerings but they're pretty pricey for me (like 4x Red Rose).

I'm looking specifically for a morning black tea and simple green tea. English breakfast style is my fave, but any simple black tea along those lines should be fine. I'm picky about my green tea, but might just be because I got hooked on it when Starbucks had Tazo. Bigelow's basic green tea is good for me and Tazo Zen is still probably my favorite. Keep the lemongrass, citrus, and sweeteners out of it. And some just taste like grass. I know it's tea and plants to begin with but ya know...sometimes it taste like grass and not tea. I don't know what to call that type of green tea in the sort of ""official"" tea name.

No Lipton. Stuff tastes like plastic to me for some reason. 

I don't mind ordering online, but if that's the route I'd prefer something I could buy by the case or maybe pound/kilo. Don't want to be ordering every other week.

Oh, and if it's supposed to be compostable I'd prefer something that is official. There's a lot of sites out there claiming this or that is compostable, but it's hard to track down any hard information. I keep mentioning Bigelow because they straight up shout it out on their website. Maybe it's greenwashing but it's better than some rando blog that says they emailed customer service.

To my utter joy and dismay, Bitterleaf Teas is doing their annual private order of Shifeng Dragonwell. Last year I went for the AA grade and that sent me back a pretty penny. It was everything I was hoping for; nutty, toasted marshmallowy, grassy amazingness!

This year with everything that is going on I was like YOLO and chose the nuclear option of the Premium/Top Grade Longjing. Although I can eat the cost, part of me is wondering is it crazy to spend over 3 dollars a gram on tea?

Dragonwell is certainly one of my favorite teas, as well as one of the most coveted. Part of me just wants to experience the pinnacle of one of my favorite teas, even if the experience does not scale with the cost.

I still buy relatively high quality pu'er (Kuraa has been my go-to lately - maybe that's not relatively high quality?

The flavor isn't super buttery has floral notes and is a light yellow. The smell had me in disbelief as to how they could get a leaf to smell like it does. Ingredients say Oolong tea leafs.  Nothing else is listed however it is repackaged by a reputable tea source I got recommended from reddit. I enjoy the tea but I prefer tea without adding anything I am going to be extremely disappointed if it is flavored. I've seen posts saying majority of oolongs are flavored or sprayed to get that buttery aroma. The vendor mentions nothing about flavoring or additives.

I have contacted the vendor but I doubt they will be honest this entire ordeal has made me angry. I am also concerned the vendor genuinely will not know whether its flavored or authentic. The vendor may be lied to as well. This seems so shady selling a product as a natural premium tea when in reality it is covered in ""butter chemicals"" what a joke. 

Is it more than likely flavored? I've heard they steam it in milk but on the next post people debunking that as false. Does no one know what they are doing to these teas? So absurd... I apologize for my rant it is just so disheartening I bought a big bag and genuinely enjoy it but will toss it if it's most likely sprayed with garbage to give it artificial scent.",Suspicious of Milk Oolong

1: ALWAYS use two bags. Maybe three. One is never enough. If you cant taste it, then add another bag.

2: steep longer than the bag says in hot water. I do 15 min under a lid to keep in the steam. For tisanes, some of the flavor escapes in the steam.

3: if the flavor is bad but you want the health benefits (like spearmint for pcos, or peppermint for ibs, and yes I know many of this community thinks tisanes are scams, but theres some research to back these up): add a lot of milk lol. Fortified oat milk in particular makes spearmint taste so soothing and delicious, and I get calcium and vitamin d while im at it

I've spent some time out west and visited lovely tea shops inspired by chinese and japanese tea, selling stuff like yxing teaware, freshly milled matcha, single origin teas, etc. This is the type of tea industry I want to work in, not a tea parlor selling blended and artificially flavored teas to people not really interested in tea as an artisanal product.

I'm currently working for a local retail tea shop but they are small and their profits are thin so there is limited room for me to develop a career with them. Is there any possibility of working with tea in more of an artisanal / specialty setting in North American, or if I want to stay in the industry do I basically have to stick to English style afternoon tea services.

God, I loved that thing. I took it everywhere with my Cuisinart temperature preset kettle and made tea for so many friends. One day, I opened my carrying backpack and found it had cracked into three pieces. I bought a replacement after that happened roughly 3 years ago — as close to the same pot as I could find, which is where that link above actually comes from.

I enjoyed that pot for some time before the stupidest piece broke — the plastic weld broke where the plunger disc meets the shaft separated, leaving the disk separate from the plunger rod. I even contacted Bodum about this, because I saw plenty of replacement strainers and french press pieces on their site, but not this plunger. Something so cheap and simple to replace, and they effectively said ""we only sell those with new pots. Please understand.""

**Summary: I'm looking for a new teapot. Infuser pot, please, nothing stove-based.

7098,tea,"Hey gang.  Long time lurker, first time poster here.  

I'm looking for some suggestions.  I'm a pretty boring tea drinker, lots of English Breakfast and basic green tea.  I don't branch out to more fun flavors and neat blenders often so could use some help.

My mother loves the TWG vanilla bourbon so much, but it is pricy to get ahold of in the states.  It is a super rich red tea.  The vanilla is subtle and natural.  It is so nutty and complex.  The smell is exactly like unsmoked pipe tobacco.   

Below is a review from someone better at writing them than me.

7099,tea,"Hi! I'm looking for an electric kettle to use for tea and coffee, and I seem to be having trouble finding one that matches what I'm looking for. Do you have (or know of) a kettle like this?

* **Notification:** Loud notification when water reaches temperature (I'm often in my office working while waiting for water to boil, and a tiny beep or no sound at all will mean I forget that I was even making a cup of tea). A slight bonus if the volume can be controlled (muted if someone is sleeping, etc.) but not required
* **Interface:** A good user interface; I hate electronics where everything is one button and it's annoying or unintuitive to change settings
* **Temp:** Should have a range of temperatures; 170-212 should be fine, and 5° increments or preset buttons would probably be fine. Should be relatively accurate/consistent
* **Material:** Interior should be completely metal or glass (no plastic inside of kettle)
* **Size:** 1-1.75 liters
* **Safety:** Auto shutoff/boil-dry protection so I don't burn down the house if I do miss what is hopefully a loud notification
* **Speed:** Boil 4 cups of water in 4-6 minutes 
* **Location:** US

&amp;#x200B;

Other considerations:

* **Spout**: Gooseneck not needed (and probably want to avoid) since we are mostly using a large 32-ounce french press or pouring water to steep tea (no pour-over or gaiwan). Our current stovetop kettle has a terrible spout and belches water all over the counter when pouring so anything will be an improvement over that.
* **Quality/Warranty:** Want something with a good warranty and/or that should last for 5+ years
* **Keep Warm:** As long as the notification is loud enough, I don't necessarily need a keep warm function; my tea/coffee brewing is spread throughout the day
* **Other**: Will appreciate if it's easy to clean occasionally (water is relatively hard here)
* **Budget:** Fine with spending up to $200 if it's worth it

I've ruled out:

1. the Fellow Corvo &amp; Stagg (no beep)
2. the Bonavita (seems to have rust &amp; longevity issues)
3. Cuisinart (also longevity issues)
4. Breville (also longevity issues)

My usual technique with making any tea is to heat up the water to the correct temperature / boiling, add in the tea leaves, let it Brew for the desired time, and then add milk / sweetener. To make it thicker should I brew the tea leaves while the water is heating up? Should I do half milk half water?

7277,tea,"I was introduced to tea in Turkey and the Hemshin tea (from Rize province but in the mountains) Çaykur sells is only CTC tea that I still drink, being IMO the best tea I've been able to find that evokes nostalgia for my time in Turkey.

I put in an order from What-Cha in January, which had both a Georgian and an Iranian orthodox tea, both of which were fantastic. The Iranian tea in particular was unusual, reminding me of a cross between musty books and potato chips. This resulted in me ordering a bunch of teas from Georgia which cab I think one of the widest range of flavors I have found for tea from such a small area.

I'm now trying to find any orthodox black or all oolong tea that I can find from the general area around the Black and Caspian Seas. In particular:

1. I would like to find, if possible, some orthodox Turkish teas. I found a site in Singapore called TWG which apparently is well known in some circles and has a lot of teas from unusual places, but with frustratingly vague descriptions on tasting notes and where specifically they are grown. They have a Rize BOP which is out of stock, but in my experience broken grades tend to brew up like CTC teas and I try to avoid them these days.  They also have a tea called Grand Istanbul, but without much information on the tea itself. And that's the only place I've found selling what looks to be Turkish orthodox tea.

2. I would like to find more Iranian teas if they do make other black or a long orthodox teas, however it appears that Lahijan maybe the only place in Iran exporting orthodox tea in which case I would still like to get more. So far I've only been able to find it from What-Cha (I will do another order when they get new stock in, but there aren't enough things they have in stock now I haven't tried to justify another international order), from a few other non-US sites which mostly sell things other than tea, and from TWG, which I will probably order from eventually.

3. I know that Azerbaijan grows tea along the black sea. But the only Azerbaijani tea I can find our second hand resellings of what is clearly CTC tea, it seems to be a similar company to Çaykur. So it would be really neat to find some orthodox Azerbaijan teas.

4. It would not surprise me if you could get some good teas from nearby areas as well, since tea grows well in a wide variety of climates and the geography of the area is such that you get a huge variety of micro climates. However I cannot identify any other areas in neighboring countries that I am aware of that grow and export tea (tried googling neighboring countries that seemed plausible and they only turned up herbal ""teas""). Still if anyone knows of interesting orthodox tea grown in the West Asia/Southeastern Europe region I'd be interested in that as well.",Other (besides Georgia) orthodox black/oolong teas from the Black/Caspian Seas?

I am a heavy drinker of tea, drinking Sencha, Bancha, Genmaicha, Gyokuro and Jasmin tea using Mao Fen green tea.

I am using an electric kettle to put water at the recommended temperature and then use a mug with a filter. I generally use \~6g for 300ml. I wait the recommended time using a timer and drink.

I wanted to look for me chinese green tea, this is why I joined this sub-reddit. But after going through the post, I saw most of you using teapot and small teacup of at most 100/150ml.

Are you drinking only 100ml of tea ? Or do you use the teapot to fill up the small teacup again ? Isn't it going to get tea colder ? Or biter if you let the tealeaf in the teapot ? Or maybe you are using a second vessel after the teapot to fill up multiple time the teacup ? Is there an advantage to use small teacup ? Maybe for expensive tea ? Is there even an advantage to use a teapot over a mug with filter ? To enjoy my high quality tea to it's fullest should I brew it using a teapot and drink in a small teacup ? Why ?

I think it may have been a music video but I am not sure since the piano in the background was very subtle. The video opens with a blonde woman getting ready. She puts on a white gown and fixes her hair. Then she welcomes two friends to the party, one is wearing a black dress with a black fascinator. They go to the garden where they begin to have tea.

7341,tea,Hello everyone. Thank you in advance for your time. I am quite tea ignorant but my wife enjoys tea very much especially loose leaf Chai and cream earl gray. I wanted to buy her a proper Chinese tea pot for her birthday and I've done some research which suggests that Yixing tea pots are best and eventually begin to add their own flavours when used with one type of tea. I've also read that there are many fakes. So I wanted to ask if there are good legitimate sources I should look at to purchase from and also if I'm going down the right path here. Thanks,Help about yixing pots please
7343,tea,"I followed [this recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/5-minute-caffeine-free-chai-mix/) to make the spice mix for chai tea, but it seems like the ginger (or pepper) is too strong for my taste, too spicy hot.  

* Since I already mixed one batch, how do I make it less hot? E.g. if I reduce the serving from 1.5 tsp. of chai mix to 1/2 tsp. per cup of milk, would I add more of a key spice (like cinnamon?) to keep the flavour while lowering the heat? 
* How could I alter the recipe for another batch? It is close to what I was hoping to taste (similar to the Starbucks chai latte), just too spicy. I want the chai blend of spices without the tea to add to milk. Or if you have a different recipe to recommend, please share.",How to make homemade chai tea mix less spicy?

I really enjoy matcha tea and I’ve been preparing it at home for several years. I am aware of the Japanese cultural background of matcha tea and I’ve been reading a lot about tea ceremonies and traditional pottery. I know the way I am preparing matcha is nowhere near how it is traditionally prepared, for example I tend to drink it with milk and also a different cup than the one I was preparing it in (that is significant to my problem)
Now, I am a design student and I have been assigned a project to create a pottery piece that focuses on practical use. I thought that creating a matcha bowl with a spout would be a good idea, because I tend to spill my matcha whenever I use a regular bowl to pour it into a cup. 
I did a good amount of research into chawan bowls and traditional Japanese pottery, and I wanted to do my design inspired by them.

7488,tea,"Hey all, 

So, I posted a while back about ordering from Jing Tea Shop and not hearing anything about the order. Well, the order finally arrived!

Except it was incomplete and only contained the ~$40 in tea and not the $160 yixing pot I ordered with it. It wasn't even included on the customs paperwork on the box. 

I emailed them from the provided email, messaged through their ""chat with us"" button on the website, found a different email on facebook, and even found the owner to message them directly. 

Not a single one of those avenues has turned up a response. 

I'm really not sure what to do here. The tea is pretty good, so I would like to order from them in the future, but I also want either my pot or a refund for goods not delivered, but can't get a hold of anyone in the company.

I decided to start again and my sleep isn't so great anymore. I wake up more, it takes longer to fall asleep, and I don't feel as rested.  I start my day at 4 am and drink one six ounce cup of tea. I prefer black tea, which has around 45mg per 8oz. I drink different kinds of black tea so the caffeine content varies, but no matter what I'm drinking it should be less than an 8oz cup of coffee. However, I notice that when I drink black tea or oolong that I don't sleep that well. When I drink a green tea, I feel fine. Green has less caffeine than black or oolong so that would make sense.

I've done research on the half-life and I've seen an average of 5 hours, but up to 9.5 hours. I have no idea what my personal half-life is, of course. But if I'm going to bed at 8 pm, could 30-40 mg of caffeine still affect me? This is sixteen hours after I consume caffeine.

Thing is, each cup leaves me with a dry throat. And that's rather unpleasant. I feel like for each cup of tea I need to drink a cup a water.

I always knew that tea could be dehydrating, but so far I did not have this problem with western style. Is this normal ? Is there anything I can do ?

7633,tea,"Hi all, 

It's Friday, I just got paid, so what's better way to spend some time than getting some more tea delivered!

To be honest I am quite new to the hobby and still in the process of trying different things to find out what works best for me. If it matters, I brew most of my tea either hybrid (more leaf, slightly smaller vessel and slightly shorted infusion) or gongfu style.

I have baskets ready in both What-Cha and Mei Leaf. Totals for tea, excluding delivery are exactly the same (it actually wasn't intentional) for both - £62.80 which is around $85 in freedom money terms. Mei Leaf charges around £5.4 ($7.3) for delivery, while What-Cha delivers for free and also throws in free 50g bag of Mystery Tea.

I appreciate that this is not, and is not meant to be like-for-like comparison, and both baskets contain completely different teas. However I allow myself to break any rules and ask you to help me choose which is ""better"" order that I should pick this time around. Unfortunately (and hopefully) won't do both at the same, because it's too much tea to consume quickly.

Details below. Fellow teaheads, please help me choose what is ""better"" for somebody fairly new to play around with.

I recently got into the world of tea. Right now I have a Lapsang Souchong, an Oolong, and a pu-erh tea. I go through 2-3 cups of the pu-erh or the Oolong each (seeping only a few oz of each and reusing for those cups). 

The Lapsang Souchong? I am going through like 6 cups. 2 refillings of oz. maybe 3 if I pour 9 cups of it through the day.

7771,tea,"A few years back I lived in a largely Slavic neighborhood (in Pittsburgh), and, ever since, I’ve been enjoying a Russian black tea called “Czar Nicholas.” 

At one point I got this adventurous, romantic notion in my head which is almost certainly very wrong. I had read that this variety of tea is a relic of the Silk Roads and it’s ancient overland convoys. Specifically, the bricks of dried tea, which would have been loaded up on camels and whatnot, would absorb traces of the smoke of campfires over many months. Once upon a time, all tea and similar goods that required distant overland transport would take on this quality, but it was largely forgotten after maritime trade predominated. Looking at the geography, it would make sense that this practiced survived in Russia long enough to remain established as a variety. 

But what is that variety called? Is Czar Nicholas actually what I envision it to be? If not, what is? and how should I classify Czar N. instead?

Please include examples of other similar teas, and, if you think you can help - Many thanks!

7886,tea,"Hi all,

Let me just start by saying that I am fairly new to the hobby. I am in the process of choosing what to pick up next from What-Cha and would really appreciate some advice from more seasoned members. I don’t really have a budget in mind (within reason) and ideally I am looking for some “must-tries” from their current stock.

What I got recently from them is:
- intro to tea set
- Taiwan Jin Xuen milk oolong
- Thailand Jin Xuen sticky rice oolong
- India Darjeeling Rohini Autumn Flush Jethi Kupi oolong

Out of the bunch, both greens (Korea Dong Cheon Daejak and Vietnamese Fish Hook) took me by surprise. Both creamy, sweet, with hints of corn and no astringency or bitterness whatsoever. The fish hook is especially interesting as I don’t get any grassiness at all even after multiple infusions. I think these 2 are my favourite of the bunch! Although I haven’t tried many greens so I don’t really have a benchmark.

Black teas I got are all good, but I almost feel they lack a bit of body to me. I still need to try them gongfu style. I really want to love Natela’s Good Standard as everyone seems to be raving about it and its sweet caramel and toffee notes, but I am not getting any of that, just smooth and clean black tea.

I haven’t picked my favourite oolong yet. The scented ones I can smell all day, but the taste probably isn’t top. I almost feel that high quality unscented oolong has better flavour.

That’s the end of my rant. What’s worth trying next?

But, in my stovetop kettle (made of metal), the water has a “fizzy” texture to it when I pour. It sounds just like pouring pop, but there’s no head, and the water is a bit white at first but clears up after a few seconds.

Anyway saw this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T3P2P2B/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1

and this kettle really seems like great value, but I cannot find anyone talking about it, reviewing it etc.

Some things that are very notable to me is, price obviously, but also the fact that it is double walled insulated, has temperature control, seems to be all stainless steel interior, and even has a strix controller. I couldn't find these things at most any price let alone this one. Most double walled kettles I found were not temperature controlled or not to this degree.

If anyone owns this can you provide any input? The reviews are a bit meh. For example is there a minimum water requirement? Is it really plastic free inside? When keeping warm does it remember the setting when you take it off the base and then return to keeping warm when placing it back on (very nice for gongfu)? Is it cumbersome to operate the temperature controls? Are they accurate?


Anyway just wanted to ask if anyone had experience with this and maybe someone else reading will be interested as well. I am quite frustrated with some of the options out there and finding this which seems to do most everything at this price seems enticing.

I will likely order this and give it a try but I want to check first before I waste the time and resources ordering and possibly returning another device since I don't like to do it too often.",Has anyone tried the Amazon Basics Temperature Controlled Kettle?

7930,tea,"Hello, friends.
I’d like some advice. 

I’ve been drinking tea and tisanes for more than a decade (I’m 27 yo).
I started with tea bags — mostly yerba mate, which is common here in South America (and I know it’s not actually considered as tea because it’s not Cammelia Sinensis) — and later got introduced to loose leaf tea.

here in my country, the consumption of high quality tea is not common at all. Not even amongst the Chinese and Japanese communities. So it’s very hard to purchase decent teas.
recently I bought some Chinese loose leaf tea and it just tasted super burnt. the leaves were also lacking uniformity of color.  

I really want to learn about tea and I realised that theory isn’t enough. So I’d like advice on decent quality tea to buy without an absurd price. Perhaps a kit with many different kinds would be perfect, so I can learn about and taste each style. 

Last year I learned about gong fu brewing and I like it so much better than Western style.

I also would like some recommendations on Japanese tea (especially matcha. the ones I bought so far were really low quality because that’s all we can find here). 

I visited Yunomi and fell in love with it. but they don’t ship to Brazil 😩😩. 

I know this is a bit broad request, but I’d really appreciate some advice on: a good tea kit (with various types) for beginners with no added fragrances, international shipping and good prices.

I've found some pretty good ideas. I want to make a salad dressing with tea leaves, but that's for later (and I'm not sure that the sleep-inducing teas would be a good idea for lunch)

Anyway, I started drinking various bagged teas for the specific purpose of helping me sleep. A coworker introduced me to loose tea, and I'm already obsessed. The short steep time, the flavor!, the aroma,  and loose tea is just so freaking pretty.  

So far I have two loose tea steepers, I prefer the simple one I found at ikea over the cute little ball strainer with a duck on the end of the chain (forgive me...I don't know what the heck these are called), some tiny spoons, tons of honey (I'm well on my way to having an unhealthy obsession with what I've been calling ""craft honey"" 🤣), a cute little tea can with a clear lid so I can view my pretty tea leaves, to name a few.

Just as often medium quality DHP versions probably are just Shui Xian, branded differently.  

That inexpensive local shop version was so good that both would be comparable for teas to have with food, but the Wuyi Origin higher quality version added extra depth, balance, and refinement beyond the experience of the other.  Both shared some inky mineral base, and a general level of warm supporting tones, with the Wuyi Origin version also expressing cinnamon, more floral tone (aromatic range), and better mouthfeel and aftertaste experience.

Glad I found this channel, great source for tea enthusiast! I've done a bit of research on different threads and online but I can't seem to find the answer to my question.

I developed a growing passion for tea over the last few months, mainly buying from Camellia Sinensis in Canada, but I was looking at other source to try different teas and price range.

As I looked into other vendors, I was wondering what is the consistency/quality of the different sourcing/appelations in tea. I come from a wine/coffee background so different rules might apply but appellations and producers have an important impact on the price and quality of the underlying (EX: Chablis has a minimum price, but there is a varying quality of Chablis AC and price depending on producers).

For example, should a Mi Lan Xiang Oolong always have the same quality standard and average price ? (considering some vendors might take higher margins). Does the family that produce the tea has a strong impact on quality as well within the appellation like it would be the case for wine? 

Another example, if I can find a Li Shan from Taiwan for 35$/50g and another one for 25$/50g, should the two teas be very similar and therefore  one vendor is simply taking bigger margin? Or it simply that one's has a superior producer/selection can be superior without the vendor needing to identify it.

 I was doing some basic research and thought the Kyusu looked attractive in that it allowed the leaves to disperse fully, theoretically allowing for a more flavourful infusion. The volume of the kyusu (roughly 200ml) is also attractive. I recognize it is usually used for green teas.

8040,tea,"I am in my 50s and have never been too much of a tea person. That started to change about 10-11 years ago when I discovered a Teavana store nearby. I got hooked on drinking tea, buying tea-making accessories, and everything associated with it. I must have had 20+ different containers that I kept loose teas I bought from Teavana. I was experimenting with different teas and loved my setup.

A few years after that I heard that Starbucks purchased Teavana and nearly at the same time the shop I loved frequenting -- where I bought all my supplies and various teas -- closed abruptly. That was it. It killed my love of tea drinking. All the trappings around it were hobby-like for me. Then it all ended. 

I would like to get that back.

It occurs to me I can get back into it by purchasing supplies, teas, etc., online. I'd love to find a local store to purchase from as I did with Teavana, but I am not aware of anything. I live in the Northern Virginia area. 

I'll be reading this subreddit and other tea-related subreddits to get myself oriented. In the meantime, does anyone have advice for me to get back into it? Online retailers to use.

8072,tea,"I emailed Floating Leaves the other day asking for advice brewing their Alishan (Winter 2021) gongfu style. Their reply was touching, and poignant advice on brewing tea (gongfu especially) and life in general. 

“(1) There will always be uncontrollable variables, such as humidity, weather, outdoor temperature, barometric pressure, your own state of being, and the tea's state of being itself. All these living variables come together to create a living experience, one that is unrepeatable and always unique. What's great is this tea seems to have 'reached out' to you, it opened up for you the first time you brewed it and showed you how good it can be! That's completely awesome. And although we all have the tendency to immediately go back and request a repeat of that experience, it can't happen. But what CAN happen, is you can let it show up very nicely again. It's like if you go to your favorite mountain lookout. Early summer will offer beautiful wildflowers. Then in the Winter you go back, and the wildflowers are nowhere to be seen. Unless you can see the beauty of the snow, you'll be disappointed. The trouble is when we become mechanical, controlled, and expect the same outcome, we will be disappointed. I'd wager that going into the first session you had very different expectations than going into the following sessions.

(2) This is where our most important variable comes in, which is our own state of mind. If you are careful and attentive, you will notice that the way you pour in the water to brew a pot of tea will change very much depending on if your mind is quiet or not. If all other variables are the same, it is easy to notice how a strong, confident stream will affect the broth, compared to a meek or overly careful one. So my advice is to not only watch the tea, but also watch yourself, mind and body, as you brew the tea. You can play with the stream, take a few breaths to calm your body, and keep an open mind. Since we are alive and the tea is alive, watching the outcome is like a beautiful dance that is always changing.

(3) Because everything is always changing, don't be afraid to change the ratio or the timing. The color of the broth will tell you way more about the tea than a scale or timer. You might run through a few mistakes from time to time, but you'll also build an intuition with practice. Some days I like 6 grams and some days I like 15. Also be aware of the time you rest between steeps.”",Got some wonderful brewing advice from Floating Leaves

8199,tea,"Firstly, please be gentle with me, I’m new to this sub and to looseleaf tea.

Over the past year I’ve become obsessed with tea, and my wife and I have around 30 different teas (mostly bagged, but we also have a few tins of matcha). 

The last two months I had become more interested in looseleaf teas and non-Western styles of brewing.

I started with a couple of Pu Erhs, though I couldn’t tell you what they were because I got rid of them almost immediately. They both tasted like dirt to me, very unpleasant and didn’t really taste like a tea. I figured that they were simply not among my preferred tastes and I was still excited to try other looseleaf teas.

More recently I was in Jungle Jim’s this week and grabbed a few tins of Harney &amp; Sons:
1.	Darjeeling
2.	Formosa Oolong
3.	Vanilla Black

I currently have and use a 12oz double-walled glass infuser (it just has a stainless filter in the spout), and I boil filtered water from my fridge in a pot on the stove.

I have tried brewing them each according to the instructions on the tins, which are Western-style: 1 teaspoon of leaves for 8oz of boiling or near-boiling water for 4 or 5 minutes.

I have also tried brewing them at a slightly lower temperature (180°F) for longer time.

Both cases I’ve been underwhelmed. Aside from the vanilla flavoring in the one, the others didn’t taste… special.

The formosa oolong didn’t taste any better than the oolong teabags we have, and the Darjeeling tasted *slightly* less bitter than the black teabags we have but I like the bitterness. 

I guess for the price and the hassle I was expecting to be wowed, but I haven’t been.

Am I doing something wrong? Or have I just not found the right looseleaf for me?

I’ve seen some people on the internet argue that looseleaf is actually cheaper than teabags, and to them I would ask, where are you buying your looseleaf tea? I can get a box of 100 teabags from Uncle Lee’s for $4-$5, but a tin of leaves that might make 50 cups is $10+ at my local stores.

Also, if I’m not drinking tea I’m probably drinking water, so it’s not like my taste buds are ruined for flavors by carbonated beverages.

Today’s review is White2tea’s [2018 White Triple](https://white2tea.com/products/2018-white-tripel)


Here is the description of the tea taken directly from the website: 

“The 2018 White Tripel is a blend of white tea that incorporates six different teas from three different provinces. The provinces of Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou are all present in the blend. The broad range of materials unite together to form a layered experience of smooth, fragrant sweetness. The Tripel has a complex floral base and creamy texture in the mouth. The flavors evolve from steep to steep as different materials contribute their character. We prefer this tea brewed gongfu style, but it also does well grandpa style or even simmered.

We hope you have the opportunity to try this unique blend of tea. Suitable for aging or immediate drinking.”

Six different white teas blended into one huh? Is it worth it. I’ll be the judge of that. 

I love white tea. I have a pretty solid collection from aged Gongmei to Silver Needle. I have had blended teas before but I don’t think I have ever had a blended white tea before. Seems like an interesting concept and I was curious if you can actually taste six different teas. 

I brewed 5 grams gong fu cha style at 75 degrees Celsius for around 20 seconds. Very light sweetness. Not a ton of flavor. 

I kicked the water temperature up to 85 degrees Celsius and brewed for another 20 seconds. Now the tea started to open up and give off floral notes. 

I kept the water at 85 degrees and steeped for about 10 seconds each time for 8 steeps. These were the money steeps. I really liked where this tea was during these steeps. Very floral on the front end. Almost delicate. Back notes of aged Gongmei and velvet like mouth feel. 

By the 10th steep I really started to push the tea and went to full boiling water. I brewed it for a full minute and with each steep after added another minuet. The floral notes have died off by now and were replaced with the indistinguishable nutty sweetness aged Gongmei has. The mouthfeel was still very smooth and almost pillow like but not as smooth and thick as the first 10 steeps.

Even though I used full boiling water on white tea there was no bitterness or anything harsh from the tea. 

The overall verdict is this is a very good white tea blend. Could I taste all 6 different white teas? No, but I did taste a well balanced blend that ranged from floral to nutty sweet cinnamon. Depending the water temperature and how long you brew this tea for depends on the experience you get. It’s kind of like a choose your own adventure. Brew it soft and light and get floral flavor with hints of sweetness. Lean into it with a long and hot brew and you get warm nutty cinnamon dates type flavor with a really thick velvet mouthfeel. 

I have not tried boiling or grandpa style with this tea yet but I will update this review when I do. 

Overall this is a very solid tea and if you like white tea this is a great one to have in your collection. If you have a refined pallet for white tea then I feel you would appreciate the blend and balance in this lovely tea. 

Not going to give it a number rating. I feel numbers cheapen the experience. But this tea is highly recommended from me. 

Thanks for listening,

So I signed up for one of the research interviews, which netted a little gift card, which could be applied to many places and I chose Amazon.

I've bought puer on Amazon before and while it wasn't bad (not fishy or anything), it wasn't exactly good. It was fine as a daily drinker, but I didn't plan to buy it again since better options can be hand for not much more money. Earthy, but rather flat and didn't get more than about 3 decent steepings. I'm hoping what I just ordered is just regular cheap puer and not total trash. The worst puer I ever had was a generic brick I bought (for too much money) at an Asian goods shop in a strip mall. It tasted like dirt and not in a good way and I actually ended up throwing it away eventually because it was so bad.

Thanks to sellers like Liquid Proust, white2tea and Yunnan Sourcing, I've been spoiled by some fairly decent teas. So it will be interesting to try a couple different shou puers from Amazon sellers and see if they're drinkable now I've been spoiled. Now if the named trusted sellers were to accept Amazon gift cards...I'd be signing up for more of these research interviews.

Fingers crossed.",Puer from Amazon - I was desperate!

Several years ago I was in St. Petersburg, Russia, hanging out with some local friends at a little church downtown. They pulled out this bucket of loose black tea leaves from the closet and made tea for everyone (making a concentrate then diluting it with water in everyone's cups). I absolutely loved this tea but no one seemed to know (or care) what brand it was. It seemed to strike my local friends as just everyday black tea.

Does anyone have thoughts on what this could have been? The closest sub I've found it Tess's ""Pleasure"" (black tea, rosehips, lemon sorghum, dried apple, cornflower petals, tropical fruit flavor), but I know that wasn't it because a) that's a bit pricier than they would have had, and b) the tea I had there didn't have any other things blended in.

I am desperately trying to recreate the thai iced tea from a restaurant in the next city (which is 30 miles away and last time I managed to crush all four cups on my way home, while trying to unlock my door).

Now first things first: it's not the milk ice tea (they have that one too, but I always buy the lemon flavor). It has a dark red (or bright when you hold the cup against the light) color, definitely not the yellow / orange color I see on pictures all the time.

I use regular tea as a base and add vanilla and star anise. So far this seems to be about right.  
Then I also added fresh (mashed) curcuma and it did smell like the one from the restaurant, but it turned somewhat bitter. Also the color changed to orange.

In another batch I added tamarind and couldn't really tell if it is a fit - I think it isn't, but quite a few recipes name it as a main ingredient. I also added cinnamon (didn't change much, maybe not enough?) and I bought clove and cardamom today, but haven't tried these.  


All in all, the tea I made so far tastes quite good, but it definitely isn't the one from the restaurant, which tastes a lot ""softer"" and fresher.  
I steep the tea for 2 minutes as it says on the packaging. Maybe that's not enough for the spices?

So anyway I tested it 3 times with a water testing strip, I put some tea and boiling water into the pot and let it sit until it cooled down and then I dunked in the test strip. I also did a control with tap water/boiled water/tea brewed in glass.

Now unfortunately (or fortunately) I don't have any lead water to test if the test strip actually works for lead but here's what I found:

The only test differences were that the alkalinity and pH were lower on both the test strips I immersed in the brewed tea, so that's probably just the tea.

The other difference I saw was that the tea from the pot was basically opaque while the tea from the glass was crystal clear, so something from the pot is getting into the water... Before this I had already boiled the whole pot and I ran multiple liters of boiling water through the pot, so I'm not sure why it still had that much ""stuff"" in it.

Anyone know why they do this? I know I could just ask them directly, but I imagine this question has been asked before but my search efforts aren't showing up anything.

I'm not a fan of Amazon's overall business practices and I avoid shopping there when possible (I don't buy tea there), but I do love their review system. I also love bad reviews, because in many cases, the ""bad"" reviews are simply laughable and shows that the reviewer isn't actually reviewing the products/business, but are just having a bad day and need to vent. So I know to not count those kind of reviews in the overall community rating of the product. But the actually critical, discerning and smart reviews are priceless.

I know there are tea review sites likes steepster, but why not have actual reviews right on the vendor's website? Crimson Lotus Teas does this, why do you think that sites like YS and w2t don't do the same?

Of course the best way to know if you should buy a particular tea is to just buy a sample and try it. Try enough samples and you can start to get a better idea of what you like and don't like. Sometimes the vendor descriptions are helpful, but what often pushes me to the ""add to cart"" is reading others' reviews. They often give less ""curated"" descriptions. I once got a sample of a 2006 Dayi Classic 66 from Liquid Proust Teas. It was part of his blind sampler set a couple years ago. Dang it was good! And if I had only read his description of it that basically read, ""got this on a deal...it's different...not sure what to think of it yet""...I would've most certainly passed on trying it. LPT also doesn't have user reviews on his site. And that Dayi tea has been one of the best ripe puerhs I've tried to date - I couldn't quite justify buying a whole 660g cake, but I did order a few more samples!

My only guess is said tea vendors just want people to try the tea without too much external opinion. They try to provide minimal description (especially in the case of w2t) so you have a basic idea of what the tea is like. I get that and yet I've found many more excellent teas by finding people who have similar tastes as my own.",Why do sites like w2t and Yunnan Sourcing not have reviews?

8347,tea,"Was just wondering - why is it rare to make tea by running water OVER the leaves, rather than steeping them?  I was thinking that coffee is brewed by both methods (infusion via French press, pour over by automatic coffee machines).

Should I try a variety pack? Or other brands I can get from AMAZON. (Bonus if it's snap EBT eligible) I know there are alot of fancy tea people in here, and as much as I would like to be, that's just not me. While I've dabbled with loose leaf before, I mostly just put a tea bag in the microwave with water which I know is basically sacrilegious for someone that says they love tea (which I do, I'm just also lazy).

just tea,

1. boil water in the morning

2. add water to thermos (add some cold water for delicate teas)

3. add loose tealeaves (oolong, puerh, and darker green teas work best for this method)

4. tealeaves swirl in thermos for a few hours.

5. unscrew lid partly, pour into cup, lid filters the leaves.

spiced tea;

1. boil water at night
2. add to thermos
3. add any combination (usualy 3) of whole spices. e.g. cinamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, black peppercorns, nutmeg, ginger, corriander, star anise (only a small morcel of anise its quite strong)
4. spices bloom overnight in the hot water

5. morning comes, add a bit of maple syrup or honey

6. add tea, usualy a black or puerh

7. maybe add a lemon or orange wedge

8. tealeaves swirl in thermos for a few hours with the spices

9. unscrew lid partly, pour into cup, lid filters the leaves and spices

10. at halfway point maybe add a bit more hot water in the day to stretch out the drink, different flavour combinations arise when its thinned out aswell.

get home, rinse out the whole thing with water and a strainer, compost the remains. repeat. it will take some experimentation with types and volumes of tea. some tea has alot of tannins which can irritate the stomach, a bit of sugar or milk can help with that. talk to the folks at your local fine tea shop and they could point you in the direction of a tea that could do well with not being strained for a few hours.

8437,tea,"Totally new to the tea, but I have other passions (beer and coffee) and I like to make experiences and knowledge from different worlds to meet together. For example, the best way (as far as I know) to store a pack of coffee that you are not goint to use shortly and that you didn't open is to put it in the freezer. This because, as everyone knows, cold temperatures slow down chemical reactions that brings organic things to get old and loose their freshness. Now that i bought 4 packs of tea, I'm worrying that the last one that i will open will taste definitely old, if I store it at room temperature (even if it's sealed. I don't think they are sealed in a controlled atmosphere with no oxygen). To me it would make sense to store it in the fridge (why not freezer? Maybe freezing tea brings issues I can't foresee, so better not risk) to ensure a little longer life to their fresh aromas.  
Anyway, getting information about storing tea, no one mentions the fridge. The usual recommendations are to store it away from light, at room temperature, and maybe at controlled humidity.

8452,tea,"I'm a bit new to the whole tea thing but I've been lurking for a while and learning a lot. I just got an order from W2T and started brewing different samples. 

I've been trying to really hone in on tasting but I'm not really seeing anything vastly different between the teas. Sometimes on some brews I can pick up a faint, faint flavor in the background but it's gone with the next steep. For example, I could pick up an extremely distant sweetness on the 3rd or 4th steep of Hot Brandy 2018 but the other steeps were just plain. I tried out Waffles 2018 and Pretty Girls 2020 and both were kind of difficult to pick any significant tastes out. Most of the time the teas just taste like a slightly weirder version of hot water. 

Here's more or less what I'm doing:
* ~7g of loose leaf in ~180mL gaiwan
* 100mL of water heated in electric kettle to 195F/90C
* Rinse for 5-7s
* First steep is 5s (+/- 1s)
* Every steep after is +5s from the last

Once I even tried letting it steep for 10-15s extra but still nothing significant coming out of it. Interestingly, I can actually smell a lot of distinct aromas from these teas before and after brewing, it's just the taste I'm not getting :/

To clarify a few things, no I don't have COVID and I can taste other things totally fine. I also have a water softener. The leaves definitely open up. Even when I see a few clumps that are stuck together, I break them apart with a fork so more leaf is exposed to the water.

8454,tea,"So I just the other day picked up a clay teapot, it was listed as coming from yixing and being made of yixing clay, but i mostly just cared about it being made of clay.

It was around 50$ for a 300ml one from a place I would trust a lot. It also came in a very fancy looking but very poorly made box, the type of thing that seems like it's designed to trick people into thinking it's high quality. Like fabric stapled to a wooden box, and it's already falling apart.
I would trust this shop especially since one of the owners seems to be a tea fanatic (not a bad thing lol) and since they even have like a tea courses including traveling to China and he personally sources teas in China etc etc etc

I did a bit of reading and it seems like yixing pots often get ""faked"" where the clay could contain some very unhealthy stuff. And now I'm kind of worried since 50$ seems a bit cheap for a real one of that size (or is pricing in Europe different?) I don't really care if it's authentic or not, I just care about whether it's safe to use or not.

I cleaned it with boiling water a few times, the pot itself smells very earthy and clay-y, not necessarily unpleasant.

Would it be Safer to get something other than a yixing one? I saw a cute ~200ml reddish zhuni clay pot for again around 50$ from yingge, Taiwan at a different shop and I'm wondering if it's better to go for that, since maybe the fake industry for this isn't as big.

Does adding honey to a herbal tea make it less beneficial? I have found Im not keen on unsweetened tea. 

Finally this is a silly one but I'm going to ask it anyways, if the tea you are making doesn't actually use any sort of tea leaves, is it actually a tea? Like for example, I like the cherry and cinnamon twinnings tea bags, but reading the ingredients, there isn't actually any tea leaves in it?

I really want to get a nice gong fu set but for now this is what I deal with.

Anyways.  Sometimes Ill steep a black tea 4-6 times with 16oz of water and it's still pretty dark.  SO I'm wondering does the color matter?  Should I keep steeping until the color is a lot lighter?  Or is color just color?

Also with gong fu, Do you typically only drink very small amounts of tea?  I know that sounds silly but I want more than a saki-size cup of tea when I'm drinking it.  I need some gong fu advice.

There is no such thing as ‘ceremonial grade’ matcha.

It does not exist. It is a Western marketing term. 

Tea producers make high grade matcha, and medium grade matcha, and matcha for making biscuits and whatever. The producers and the tea shops name these matchas. Western sellers  invented 'Ceremonial grade' to sell matcha.

If a matcha's good enough to make koicha (thick), it’s good enough a tea ceremony with. But some amazing matchas are specifically intended to be made as usucha (thin), and are completely delicious.

While I’m at it, you don’t make ‘gong fu’ tea with Japanese tea – you just make tea.

My boyfriend and I have 1 stovetop kettle (just a cheap $10 Walmart kettle, nothing fancy) that we used for boiling water for coffee, tea, and cocoa. But recently he's begun brewing his coffee straight in the kettle for a stronger brew because his semester has started and work has been especially draining for him right now. I haven't been drinking much tea so it has been fine, but I'm on a new migraine medication that's making me fatigued in the middle of the day, so I'm needing a pick me up cuppa. I've had to resort to microwaving the water and then transferring it to my mug with my steeper that I'll be drinking from. But I don't want to play stop and start with the microwave and my thermometer to measure the right temperature, especially since most of the tea I drink is black and requires higher temperatures, so longer microwave times. 

Here's my question: should I splurge for an electric kettle (and if so, what are some of your recommendations)? Or just get another stovetop kettle? I use a thermometer with the stovetop kettle anyway but it's less of a hassle to leave the thermometer in the spout rather than opening and closing the microwave every minute to make sure I'm not super boiling.

For Christmas I was gifted a zojirushi thermos for tea drinking (SV-GWE50) something that I had been wanting for a long time. 

I've been happily using it for about a month or so until I noticed that it seem to leak quite a bit. Initially it would not do this but it got to the point where consistently the whole bottle would be soaked in tea after pouring a few cups out. 

I'm thinking that there are some tea leaves or brown rice bits stuck in the cap that are preventing the tea from pouring smoothly out, I think I noticed this problem get bad once I had poured some genmaicha into it. 

I can't really find a way to get into the cap aside from seemingly breaking it, which I do not want to do incase of compromising its heat retention capabilities. 

I'm thinking of trying some zojirushi stainless steel bottle cleaner, I can't find any locally but can order this stuff online. Apart from that, I might have to send the bottle back.

8744,tea,"Daily Tea #5 White vanilla Grapefruit, Harney &amp; Sons, White Tea: Temp: 82c / 179 f Tea Ratio: 1 Tea bag per 24 oz steep time: 3 min I'm not distinct precisely where I got this tea since I've never bought Harney &amp; Sons before but I'm pretty sure that I 'borrowed' it from my workplace when the pandemic started. And for the price I payed it's pretty good. Upon opening the package I could immediately smell an unexpected strong musty smell that nicely transferred over to the actual brew. I'm unsure what precise ingredient give the tea this flavour, but it's a style that I'm definitely a fan of in black teas. Aside from the musky notes, this tea has quite the long lasting aftertaste which lingers pleasantly for several minutes after the initial tastes of vanilla have dispersed. I don't know if I agree with the description of this tea as grapefruit flavoured any more then I'd call bergamot grapefruit flavoured, but this blend definitely has a passing relationship with the light and airy notes of citrus. I would not recommend adding any sugar what-so-ever to this tea. I found that adding some turned‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­the naturally strong and vibrant tastes into a cloying and suppressed flavour. Surprisingly enough the aforementioned mustiness of the tea does work when the tea is cold if that's something you're inclined to like, as I do, however I suspect that this iced tea is not for everyone. The same warning for sugar applies to this tea when iced; I didn't even finish my sugared cup of iced tea and I will not be adding sugar to it in the future. A word of warning for you all, the packaging and the website both say to steep it for 2 to 3 minutes with at a standard temperature for a white tea and they are not joking. The tetrahedral teabag helps it to brew quickly. I only steeped it for barely 3 minutes and it seemed a little too strong for my tastes, so this is not a tea that you can walk away from. I expect that I'll continue to have drink this tea if it's offered to me or if I find myself in the mood for something a little different, however this the will not be replacing my standard black teas nor will it be one of my recommendations for new tea drinkers. This is definitely a better choice for the a more refined palette looking for a boldly flavoured and textured tea. &amp;#x200B; Rating, hot: 4/10 with sugar: 2/10 Rating, cold: 4/10 with sugar: 1/10",Daily Tea # ?

The Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580087450/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_NE8KFSAPTQFW53WN7PAA
I really enjoy how thorough and how deep the authors get on every variety of tea. They really create a book that would be helpful for beginners or experienced drinkers. I would recommend getting a physical copy of the book or an ebook. I made the mistake of using an audible credit to purchase this one and although it’s still a great listen, it would be better to see it in front of me. 

For All the Tea in China: How England Stole the World's Favorite Drink and Changed History https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143118749/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_K6E16QYQ45JBKDNC1XNJ

9004,tea,"Hello all! I’ve been a coffee aficionado for a while now and have recently considered taking the plunge into tea. I’ve really enjoyed the ritual of making coffee properly and discovering new flavors and varietals, but lately the caffeine is getting a little much (particularly because lighter roasts have the most flavor diversity, but also the most caffeine). I’ve been trying to find something to replace coffee but still have a similar calming routine and room to explore flavors. 

I was wondering if you all would point me in the direction of any good resources regarding picking teas or potentially any recommendations yourself. Is it best to just buy a bunch of samples and try them? How much should I buy into the tasting notes before buying? Are there teas with less caffeine than others?

This may be largely for Canadians.

I'm just getting into tea and bought some from David's Tea in their current sale.  Looking into a bunch of online and local retailers (Calgary) and Harney &amp; Sons seem to be amazingly priced (even with USD conversion/shipping charge) compared to other places.

Is that the best bet to get good tea for a fairly good price (I'll probably get some black teas and Milky Oolong from them) than anywhere else or am I missing something?  Downside seems to be I'd be essentially buying bulk (I'd probably buy 4x1lbs bags).  My understanding is the tea isn't like coffee so it's fine if I keep the bad unopened or in air tight / no light containers for a decent period of time but please correct me if I'm wrong.  Not sure if I can freeze them like I can beans.

I went through the vendor list and locally looked at Tea Trader and Naked Leaf.

I don't think these are exactly identical but here's a price comparison as an example:

Naked Lead (Milk Oolong) - **$38 CAD / 100g**

David's Tea (Guangzhou Milk Oolong) - **$25.96 CAD / 100g**

Tea Trader (Jin Xuan Milk Oolong) - $21 CAD / 125g (**$16.80 / 100g**)

I need a new “go-to” drink, and it needs to be sugar free / keto, or at least reasonably close, or the sugar alone is going to kill me.

One time, someone made me a dark, creamy, “chai tea” though I know he added tons of stuff to make it awesome, and it rocked.

I don’t know why I haven’t experimented with this before, but it seems I could get a keurig cup or something similar for chai tea, brew it in water, and add heavy whipping cream. This might give me a creamy, keto, and delicious tea that would be perfect! But there’s a dozen little questions I have as a non-tea drinker I’m hoping you folks can help me with.

Does chai tea exist in keurig form? Is it just as easy to brew it some other way? (I don’t at all mind investing in a solution, if this is going to be a go-to drink let’s optimize it and make life easier).

Does chai usually have caffeine in it? Do I need to supplement the caffeine if it doesn’t? Can anyone recommend any masala chai brands that do have caffeine?

I assume some tea drinkers probably supplement caffeine and there’s a super easy way.

If I’m just doing tea brewed in water + heavy whipping cream, are there any other magic spices or additives I should consider? Like keto powered cinnamon?

Do any of you guys do keto and maybe you’ve solved a similar need? Did this work?

Here's my situation:

I live in germany. Tap water is very good here, low chlorine levels and scale only builds up over moths of use. However, I recently moved and now all my tea tastes rather flat. Even increasing the leaf to water ratio or temperature just yields a thin brew.

I'd like to avoid the classic water filters (Brita Style), because there's a ton of controversy about their effectiveness, most trustworthy reviews give them 3/5 at best and they're expensive.

What are my options here?

* Bottled water. Would take a lot of time and testing to find out which brand I want and depending on the brand it might not be cheap in the long run. Also, I usually consume at least 1L of tea per day, so dealing with all the bottles would be a hassle.
* Other filters. No experience here. RO with adding minerals back afterwards seems like an option, although I'm not sure if I can afford it. Any other suggestions or experiences here?
* Any other ideas on making the best out of tap water? Does leaving it out in a caraffe to aerate do anything? I heard of active charcoal to add ""good"" minerals into the water?

Essentially I'm simply looking for other people who already have experience with making the best out of suboptimal tap water situations. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated as I don't have the money or time to try everything out myself (Need the money to buy more tea xD)

9390,tea,"Hello r/tea ! I come from the world of coffee and thought it’d be great if I dabbled in tea as well. One of the things I love about coffee is how scientific you can get making it. For example I use 20 g of coffee and 340 g of 205 F water for a 1:17 ratio, I grind my beans at a precise setting, etc. I’m hoping to approach tea in the same way. For example, I just got a hold of some silver needle tea from O5 and I’m brewing it as recommended in western style (4 g tea and 240 g of 75 C water, steeped for 4 minutes).

9391,tea,"I live in Belgium and receive Chinese packages with tea monthly. I am subscribed to the W2T club and also order from W2T and other webshops that ship directly from China.

Until recently I rarely had any issues but then the EU decided to change the rules:

* Before mid '21 packages that were cheaper than € 22 were free from import duty and VAT. This meant that most packages, even the ones more expensive than € 22, were often overlooked.
* After mid '21 all packages coming from outside the EU are subject to import duty and VAT. (This in itself I don't mind, the duty and VAT are usually a couple of euros extra and I also think it's only fair to pay taxes on something just as I do for products I buy within the EU.)

What really bothers me, however, is that Bpost (BE national postal services), which somehow handles all Chinese packages, charges me a flat rate of € 15 per package for handing it over to customs and for dealing with the formalities. They say you can declare it yourself but that this process is complex and time consuming. 

On large orders € 15 is not that much but on small orders and on my club packages this often more than 40% of the cost of the tea. I also recently found out that large orders are being sent divided over multiple packages which means I'm sometimes being charged double.

This makes buying tea directly from China a great deal more expensive and I'm looking for any tips or tricks to avoid these extra costs.

Many thanks!",How to avoid import costs in Belgium from Chinese packages?

This is a saga of being ""taken in"" by what I thought was merely an interesting tea Type that I wanted to know, or try.

First, I have good respect for Scott and the team at Yunnansourcing and until I find an unquestionably better vendor, I'm sticking with them - they get 90% of my business.  Awhile back, in order to try more of the top-rated Black/Red teas at YS, as I typically would I looked at only teas that had more than a few ratings, and high ratings \[the tendency of all of us is to not be mean/nasty in ratings/reviews even when warranted\].  I saw/read every word of review of two different versions of something new-to-me, Jin Jun Mei.  I assumed casually that ""everybody knows this Type"" or style except me - 'wrong!'. But the reviews of the ""Classic Robust Jin Jun Mei Black of Fujian"" were favorable and interesting, so I jumped on 100G to find out.  It was/is VERY good black tea for my taste buds and was tummy friendly, which is something I watch carefully and mark in my notes.  Good.  So later after chatting on Discord with a couple of other people about JJM's from another vendor or two \[neither seemed to have a lot of 'buzz' in the community\], I decided to have a competition to see if any of the other JJM could beat the first one I tried.  I bought all but one, I think, of YS's offerings, which are varied, in small amounts: 25 and 50G, Plus a rebuy of the original ""Classic Robust"" in larger amount.  All four of the other ones were a ""bust"":  ""Competition Grade"", ""Pure Gold"", ""Imperial Grade"", ""Premium Grade AA"".  Three of them were just lousy to my 30-tea-years-experience tastes, including the most expensive of the bunch \[good marketing.... typically people that 'buy up' will defend their own integrity by saying nice things about their decision\].  

So I went looking for answers because my ""antennae were twitching"".  If you are one of the rare people that knows how to read VERY CAREFULLY Wikipedia pages, look very closely at the structure here, the 'folks' involved, notes, etc:  [Wiki-typical for Jin Jun Mei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Jun_Mei_tea)

 Next read this one: [Wiki2 JJM](https://wiki2.org/en/Jin_Jun_Mei_tea)

Look at dates, and every word - get the feel....

Then take a look at this:  [TeaGuardian's take on JJM](https://www.teaguardian.com/quality-varieties/tea-varieties/jin-guanyin-black-tea/)

I have to chuckle looking back on it all. There are lots of other articles and salesmanship on ""JJM"", but that's enough.  Oh, I forgot to say I also tried one from [https://www.tealyra.com/](https://www.tealyra.com/).  It was no worse than the others, above...

YMMV!

And LET ME REPEAT:  Whatever the real name is or should be of the variety/type that YS sells under the banner ""Classic Robust Jin Jun Mei"" - it is a WIN, and I really enjoy it \[Thanks Scott!\].  It has sympathy with their ""Tu Cha"" enigmatic and frustrating black, their ""Sweet Potatoe"", in being rich, dark, strong if you allow it, aromatic, 'wet', not bitter if you don't push it, and generous. It is the best so-called JJM of the .. is it 5 or 6 I tried, BY FAR and I am DONE with them.

I read an article that mentioned in passing that the tea leaves used for black and oolong tea are older than those used for green tea. That is to say, green tea leaves are picked right away whereas black and oolong leaves are left on the plant longer.

Is this true at all? I'm having trouble finding other sources for this info. Aren't leaf buds very young? In which case a very tippy black tea (Dian Hong / Yunnan Gold as an extreme example) would have young leaves, right?

The oolong varieties I've tried have had *huge* leaves when compared to most of the full-leaf black teas I've had. Does that mean those are older leaves? Or would it just be that whatever cultivar is used for those oolongs has bigger leaves?",Leaf age by tea type?
9496,tea,"I’m not new to tea but new to pu'erh. My first experience was a fishy loose pu'erh. Meh. Later I saw and appreciated /u/LiquidProustTeas post about his annual sampler to help broaden our experience of pu'erh.

The LP sampler arrived in early December—a plethora of mystery envelopes. For, essentially, the price of shipping cost, there was a ton of tea. 

The envelopes offered little information with scribbles such as ""2014 Jinggu,"" ""2010 Gushu,"" ""2012 Honey Fragrance.""

It took me a while to figure out how to brew at 6500F. Water boils at a lower temperature where I live. I began with 185F and hated nearly all the samples I tried. I've figured out to leave less water in my tea kettle and bring the temperature up to 200-212F with better results.

(Keeping a pu'erh journal to log each tea and my reaction to it has been valuable.)

I experimented with temperatures and ""flash steeps"" during the last month before settling on what works for me, always starting with a 3-5 sec rinse.

By the end of December, I'd learned a lot about how to brew and steep. I feel this is a very personal process, so I'm not going into detail about it. Like tea itself, what works for me, may not work for you.

Initially, only one pu'erh stood out:  2005 Changtai. Wow. Fantastic. This mystery pu'erh continues to stand out for me.

But... I've been going back over all the samples, taking more time/days with each of them, realizing my first reactions were poorly informed, poorly brewed, or steeped.

Today, a tea I'd dismissed after a couple of sips is quite interesting:  2015 Naka Shou. Once I got past the hay/barn steeps, there's a sweetness that lingers in later steeps.

So... for those like me who are genuinely new to pu'erh, I can't recommend the LP sampler enough when Andrew offers it again. Other vendors provide samplers, too. I expect to be sampling between LP and other vendors for a long time.

Also, if you're new to pu'erh as I am:  take your time. Experiment with your tastings, and revisit those you thought were ""bleh"" when you first tasted them. I've been pleasantly surprised, and I'm not even near done experimenting.

I'm on day 3 of the 2015 Naka Shou. :)

9497,tea,"I have an unfortunately mixed relationship with tea. I absolutely *adore* tea and all of its flavours and the ceremony and the calmness brewing it brings and all that kind of stuff, but I also have a pretty low tolerance for caffeine - drinking much more than about 350ml of tea in a sitting starts to make me feel pretty unpleasant. I've tried gongfu-style brewing and love the idea of it, but when you drink tea alone 95% of the time, getting your money's worth out of the five or six grams of tea it takes means you have to drink a lot of steepings, and the caffeine in all of that adds up pretty quickly. So I've been trying to find ways to get a gongfu-like experience with less caffeine consumption without feeling too much like I'm wasting good tea leaves.

My first thought was to just do sort of 'Western-style brewing in a gaiwan' - i.e. less tea for longer, just using the really nice teaware I already have - and so I put two grams into a hundred-ish millilitre gaiwan and did it for about two minutes. After a while, though, I realised that this was actually way oversteeping the tea, and so I tried to experiment a bit more; what I'm starting to settle on seems to be something that's inbetween gongfu-style ~5g/~100ml/&lt;10s steep times and Western-style ~2g/~300ml/&gt;=2m steep times. Two grams of tea in a ~100ml gaiwan seems to work well in the 30s - 1m range (though this morning 30s seemed a bit much for the red tea bing I was using), and I can get three good steepings for my use of two grams before I have to stop for caffeine reasons. 

(Just to try and get a bit more value out of the leaves before throwing them out, I usually cold brew the used leaves and drink that the next morning. It's not super great with teas that really need hot water to get the flavour out, but it's still something.)

I'm curious if anyone's tried something like this before (it's probably not as original as I think it is!), and if anyone's got suggestions for how to improve on the idea.",A hybrid style of tea - something between gongfu and Western brewing

9545,tea,"I may be the only person in the world who cares about this, but just in case anyone else is weird like me, I thought I would share this trick that I figured out.


The discovery of the problem: 


When I studied abroad in the UK (I'm American), I noticed that when I used a tea bag the bag would sink and become fully submerged into the liquid after a minute or two. This was in contrast to my experiences back home where there would always be some air caught in the bag, making it stay afloat the whole while.


The sinking bag appealed to me. Here are the reasons why:


1) I imagined a better infusion was happening (no idea if that's actually true or not).


2) I imagined the tea would cool slightly faster (again, no scientific evidence)


3) I simply liked the aesthetic of that airless bag calmly suspended in the liquid. It usually didn't sink all the way to the bottom, it seemed to have a fairly neutral buoyancy, so it would sit there, mostly vertical, just barely touching the bottom. This is the main appeal of sinking bags, for me. 
A bag full of air sitting all the while on the surface looks messy and unappealing to me compared to the majestic form of an almost neutrally buoyant, airless bag.


The search for a solution:


When I returned home and resumed using my go-to brands of tea I was sad to find none of them would sink. For years I tried tearing tiny holes in the bags to let the air out, which worked, but would often let some leaves out, which was no good.


Now, after years of anguish, I have two great solutions:


1) Straw solution: take a straw and press its business end directly on the air bubble at the top of the floating tea bag. Try to get the whole hole against the bag so that it will sort of seal when you suck. Then, suck a little. You probably won't get all of the air on the first suck, you'll get some of it and then you'll start to get liquid. As soon as liquid is coming through, stop sucking and let the liquid fall back in. Repeat the process until you've pulled most of the air out and the bag sinks. You shouldn't be pulling any liquid up the straw more than a few inches.


2) Turkey baster solution: use a turkey baster instead of a straw. (PREFERRED METHOD)

3) (note: I haven't tried this, but I'm just guessing it will work). A baby ear/nose cleaner/sucker thing. I don't know what these are called. They're like little mini basters used to pull boogers and clumps of ear wax out of baby noses and ears, respectively. If you happen to have a NEW one of these it would probably work great. I think they also might be used for enemas. Again, if you have a NEW one, it will probably work. Use at your own peril if it isn't brand new lol.


And that's it. I was using the straw method for a while and just thought of the baster this morning, which works great and is probably your best option if you have one since they're designed for high heat and you aren't wasting plastic straws (assuming all you have is plastic ones). You can of course reuse the straws many times, but I have a habit of misplacing them so I prefer the baster for now.

Let me know if you have ever considered the floating bag to be a ""problem"" and if any of you actually read this far, lol, thanks!

9550,tea,"Hi, y'all. So I've recently started drinking hot tea (American southerner here, I've been doing sweet iced tea since I was young enough to also be breastfeeding). I'm loving it, but it took me a *long* time to get it to a point where I liked it. 

I typically use 24ish ounces (±700ml) of boiling water (got me an electric kettle, like civilized folk), and 2 twinings brand Irish Breakfast Tea tea bags, and I steep it for 20 minutes. 

I am aware this is significantly longer than is generally done. But it always tastes ""thin"" or watery if I do less than that. I'm doing college classes at home, and will make this in a big metal travel mug that keeps it hot for hours, and drink it all day. Normally 3ish cups a day or more. 

I'm also using powdered coffee creamer in it, which I'm pretty sure just made everyone in this sub go ""oof."" (If it helps, I make my own using freeze dried milk and spices)

I'd like to know if I need to steep it like this because I'm buying some really crap American weak tea, or if it's because I just have a taste for.much stronger tea than normal? I'd like to try some other brands, but don't know where to start.

9559,tea,"Call me crazy, but... 

For almost a year now, since I discovered my morning coffee was the reason my stomach had turned into a boiling acid pit, I've been drinking loose leaf tea every morning through a somewhat makeshift method: I poured water just off the boil over the leaves in a Pyrex measuring cup, let them steep 5-7 mins, then poured them through a mesh pasta strainer into a cup. It wasn't fancy, but I got a delicious cuppa every time. (For reference, I drink August Uncommon's ""Jet Black"" most mornings.)

Christmas rolls around, and my partner very kindly gets me a fine mesh tea strainer from Finum to simplify the process. The problem is, somehow, the tea doesn't taste as good through it. The bitterness comes through, but none of the sweet, caramel-y notes that I love from this tea. The first time I used it after Christmas I legitimately thought I was having c0vid loss-of-taste. 

I haven't changed anything about my process except for the strainer; I even tried adding a little more tea (normally I used a tablespoon) and the flavor was only marginally better.

9653,tea,"Review of a good tea reference text, the Geography of Chinese Tea.  It covers a lot of tea areas, not just the more familiar ones, including details on many tea types, processing steps, plant types, geography, and history, with just a bit included for traditional legends.  It's based on many years of research and experience of visiting those places by the author, Sergey Shevelev, the founder of Moychay.  A lot of people pass on interesting stories and experiences based on visiting China a limited number of times, from talking to local producers and vendors, and this represents a much expanded version of that.  The content was collected over a decade, per the author, probably with added in-depth research based on access to a range of Chinese language information sources.

Tea books aren't for everyone, and this isn't set up to help you brew tea, all abstract background instead.  I did mention links to a few online video sources for basic information in this post, including Sergey's channel, Farmerleaf's, Tea DB (a blog), and Tea House Ghost's (kind of vendor channel and reference source).  Mei Leaf isn't so bad (which I didn't mention), but to me it's annoying watching sales oriented content, and their videos are 80-90% generally good background and 10-20% geared towards selling that product, as I see it.  It's not hard to filter that part back out but I'd just as soon not, and their content is more general than I can still learn from.

I like brewing with lots of water and having the tea become more and more tannic and dark and also cooler as I sip slowly over the course of an hour. Not exactly delicate, but I enjoy it. I like seeing the color of the tea too, so clear is a must. 

The one caveat is that I hate double walled cups. In my experience they're always incredibly delicate and I don't want my tea insulated. I like it when it gets to that slightly lukewarm temperature haha. 

The other one caveat is that the mug has to be big. Like 12-16 oz. This has been hard to find. I've been thinking of just using a beer stein, but I'm not sure if those will respond well to heat.

4. Is your schedule fluid or static?

5. What about your wares?

6. If you don't have a schedule, what is your approach?

My schedule is reasonably simple. I have a bit of a floating bedtime, but I drink two lipton black tea bags three times a day currently. I have mental health needs to change this up now and then, but I take 400mg of caffeine as a fixed max. So currently I have two bags when I wake up, two bags about three to four hours later, and another two at the same interval. I'm gonna be mixing it up after a doctor's appointment tomorrow though, but that's the rough idea. I always drink alone, but I'm typically around my family at some point, so sometimes they're around when I'm drinking.

To be honest, due to cost, I fully expect Lipton to be the skeleton of my routine, but I'd like to add a floating specialty tea in there now and then. I fully identify as a practical dirtbag tea enthusiast who has two NY Post mugs coming in the mail and loves other cheesy mugs, but I can dig trying new teas as a treat. So depending on caffeine content, I might start throwing that in there at whim as early as next month.

Basically, my partner and I just tried this Vermouth wine (with an orange in it) at a fancy restaurant, and we both sipped it and immediately went, ""oh my god, why does it taste just like that tea we used to drink at the mall?!"" 

So, TLDR, we drank a wine that tasted UNCANNILY like one of Teavanna's old blends. Anyone else every have this experience, or remember what the Youthberry blend really tasted like? And do the teavanna Youthberry sachets they sell now actually taste anything like the old blend?

I would say the wine tasted a bit like hibiscus and apple with, obviously, orange flavor from the orange. But we are also complete wine noobs.

I now know it's not tea, but my gear!

About two months ago I switched to bottled water, to have the best quality water possible. It tasted better for sure, but overall, my cups were getting less and less enjoyable. Also, I get my tea from a local teashop, who import their teas and make their own blends, so I'm sure about the quality too.

The problem was my kettle : an old (at least 13 years old) plastic kettle, with iron tubes at the bottom to heat the water. I used a clean saucepan to boil my water, and (spoiler alert) it was fantastic.

9794,tea,"I have two problems - TLDR:

1. Matcha is bland
2. Foam collapsing

I've been trying all sorts of methods to make a matcha latte but I can never figure it out. I like Starbucks' Pure Matcha Latte (which is different from the regular matcha latte and probably not available in other countries) and some other cafes, and even then it is a hit or miss. 

I use a matcha powder of a grade somewhere between culinary and ceremonial. Usually barista grade or something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bland Matcha Problem**

I've tried with 50ML of water, 2 teaspoons of powder and 150ML of milk. I use a chasen for the matcha. I use water probably around 70 degrees C. I think I've even tried 3 teaspoons which is way more than most online recipes and even then, it doesn't taste strong enough or it feels like something is missing. 

I know that Starbuck's Pure Matcha Latte is made with 4 teaspoons of powder for Venti (591ML). That is way less in concentration than what I'm using. How is it so much stronger in taste? I don't really want to spam powder because it's expensive.

I've tried different milks because I thought that may be the problem too. So far I've tried low fat and full fat milk and almond milk. None of them makes a difference although almond one makes it taste like almond which isn't what I want.

&amp;#x200B;

**Foam Problem**

I thought that maybe my latte is missing something because I don't have a good foam. I can't afford those steam wands in coffee machines unfortunately. I use the portable milk foam wand. It always foams way too much but when I use it for a shorter duration, the foam collapses. 

Most annoyingly, **when i mix the foam of the matcha with the foam of the milk, the bubbles start to merge and collapse with the sizzling sound.** It's gross to say the least. Is getting a greenish matcha foam only possible with a milk steaming machine?

When I use the wand on the matcha latte (ie. matcha water + milk mixture) itself, it does not foam well and gives gross bubbles, kinda like soapy water.

If it matters, I microwave my milk to around 50-70 degrees C prior to using the foam wand.

I only started drinking tea that wasn't Southern Style Sweet (yes, I am a Southern) about a year and a half ago.  I have a fairly strong love for Earl Grey, Russian Caravan, Orange Blossom and Chai Teas; however, I'm looking to expand outwards into other varieties.  I'm not very sold on green teas as of yet, but can be convinced to try anything once.   


(Part of the reason I'm not sold on green teas, is every tea shop I've been to where I've ordered one, even after allowing to steep, the tea always just tasted like hot water, not even subtle taste notes.  Matcha being the only exception. So I want to chalk it up to bad restaurant not bad tea.)

I am looking for your advice😊 

The other day was walking in town and noticed a teashop (I guess its new, maybe not, never noticed it before tbh 😁) and was like - why not step in? Walked out with three packs of tea and a cast iron teapot. 

Now I am faced with a dilemma. I love the pot but I feel that my average mugs don’t really cut it (favourite mug is this big dog-head shaped thing with ears). Especially if I want to serve it to guests (I still use the dog mug, dont worry 😁). 

They do have cast iron cups in the shop that would match the teapot perfectly, but I tend to drink either black tea 80-100c or green tea that you heat up at 70-80c and feel, that I will just end up burning myself with those cast iron cups 🤔I know I can let it stay in the cup for five minutes to cool down, but I am not lukewarm tea fan (especially during colder weather).  

So wondering if you guys might suggest some interesting/cool cups that would look good with the teapot. I prefer minimalistic, not too bright stuff. But if you have some awesome super bright and colourful set that would definitely change my mind, or you just want to show off tour 300 yo Chinese set, then feel free to throw it in as well 😁

I wanted to try drinking traditional matcha, not only for the flavor but also for the many health benefits and sustained energy it offers. When trying the real thing, however, I found the flavor to be quite jarring.

I'm sure it's because I am used to the matcha flavor being present with a slew of other additives, but it just tastes wrong.

I taste the distinct matcha flavor somewhat but can't pick up any of the sweetness or butteriness it's supposed to have.

I have a question about how tea leaves are made, specifically green teas and pu-ers. In general, I like knowing the in depth process of how things are made! I have seen those handy charts showing the differences between oolongs, green tea, black tea, etc. But they do not go super in depth about the process. I'm specifically wondering about how gluten makes it way into teas.

I'd like to add some context to my question, so that you can understand the full depth here. Disclaimer, I will talk about some medical things, but I am in no way asking for medical advice, I'm just providing some context for my question. 

I have celiac disease, and as a result I cannot eat anything that contains or is cross contaminated with gluten (found in wheat, barley, rye). For obvious reasons, I do not drink barley tea, however, what really surprised me is that green tea has been found to have trace amount of gluten in it. My doctor has been following a scientist that randomly tests products for gluten and their green tea testing has repeatedly come back with trace amounts of gluten. I have also found that I have reactions to pu-er tea, (I have put both teas on my ""do not eat/drink"" list)

Now I know that tea-leaves should not have any gluten in it. However, I'll go on a side tangent to tell another story. I also have an egg allergy. I would drink wine occasionally, and always have some kind of reaction. For awhile I could not figure out why, was I allergic to wine as well even though I could eat grapes? Then I found out that many wine makers will either use fish bladders or eggs whites to strain their wines. It's something that is not widely talked about but I was grateful to learn. So this made me very curious about teas and gluten. I always thought that it was due to a shared facility with gluten but maybe it's coming from somewhere else? Where in the process could this be happening?

Again, full disclaimer I am not asking for medical advice. Even though I cannot drink green or pu-er tea, that won't stop me from learning all about it! Do you have any favorite tea-making sources or knowledge that could help me understand the tea leaf-making process better? Or where do you think this trace amount of gluten could be coming from? 

Mods, if this post is too close to medical talk, I'll understand if it's removed and I'll keep searching elsewhere.",Tea-making process and gluten?

10059,tea,"For some background, I don't drink a lot of matcha straight up, but love a matcha latte (doesn't have to be sweetened) or matcha pastries/cookies/creams etc. I love the experience of trying new teas even if I don't end up loving the teas themselves, but with matcha especially it seems like such a waste if I only try one serving and end up not liking it-- so, I tend to order it when I'm out and about, and subsequently haven't really kept track of the qualities I've liked or disliked. 

So anyway, I bought my mother some of Kettl's matcha-white-chocolate-coated-almonds as a present, just tried one myself and was totally blown away by the matcha they use. I honestly feel like I could drink it every day and be blown away every single time. 

The label specifies their Hukuju matcha, which is currently sold out, so if you've liked any matchas from Kettl specifically, I'm looking for recs (but I'm also open to other vendors, like Ippodo)-- what are some matchas you really love, and why do you like them? 

As far as matchas I've tried straight up, in case anyone else has also had these:   
\- I wasn't a fan of What-cha's Wazuka Samidori, which I found a touch bitter.   
\- I liked Postcard Tea's Uji matcha prepared as usucha; I found it quite balanced and smooth.   
\- I get on well with Mei Leaf's Master's matcha as usucha or koicha; I like how sharp and clear it is.   
\- As I mentioned above, Kettl's Hukuju matcha (at least in combination with the almonds) was mind-bogglingly delicious and I need more of it in my life.

10060,tea,"I'm very new to tea and trying to research online has left me with more questions than answers. So far I've bought a basic gong fu set and the 5 tea 5g sampler from Verdant Tea (which is a vendor I've seen the sub has mixed opinions about). I've tried a few of the teas and enjoyed them but my only reference is supermarket tea bags. I honestly couldn't even tell you what type of tea I prefer at this point. My goal right now are to develop a better palate for tea but also not spend too much money as a college student. 

So here are a bunch of questions I have about buying tea:

As someone who really can't distinguish between a decent tea and a really good tea, should I stick to cheaper stuff right now? What price range would you recommend?

At what point does spending more money on tea give diminishing returns on quality?

Are samplers a good idea or should I pick out individual teas to try?

Are there any specific vendors/samplers/teas you would recommend for a beginner? (I've looked at the recommended vendors list and it's a bit overwhelming)

Would you recommend trying pu er tea as a beginner?

I also have a couple questions about brewing tea:

For the few personal gong fu sessions I've done I used about 2.5g leaves for about 50mL water. Is that enough leaves/does doing it that way defeat the purpose of gong fu?

How do you learn to pick up on different tasting notes? Does it just happen over time?

Is it easier to detect different flavors from nicer teas?

10062,tea,"Hi! I'm quite new to good tea, but I'm quite used to good coffee. As far as I see it, there are a lot of similarities between specialty coffee and good tea. As far as I understand, traceability, freshness, and a deeper understanding of the thing you soak in water are important for both coffee folks and tea folks.

The main difference though (as I see it) is that there are quite a lot of coffee bloggers/influencers/persons exercising a more scientific approach to coffee brewing, using refractometers to read the extraction yields in the cup, trying to understand the underlying physics behind a tasty cup of coffee, weighing the coffee and the water on 0.1-gram scales and hating the coffee scoops since you can't estimate the weight of coffee with it, etc.

On the other side, I don't see much of this in tea. I see a lot of recipes using teaspoons to measure the amount of tea, I see influencers that say that you should use feeling to determine the right temperatures and stuff, I see people saying that different teaware produces different tea (which of course might be true, but why not use the glass teaware to make sure it doesn't affect your tea?). I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's quite a new thing to me.

First of all, I'm wondering if some of you feel the same way?

Second of all, do you know any tea persons with blogs/books/youtube channels, who exercise a more scientific approach to brewing tea, and not only say that ""X affects Y"", but more like ""X affects Y because of Z and yes there was a recent paper on this""?","Coming from specialty coffee, wondering if there are any blogs with a bit more scientific approach to brewing tea"

10114,tea,"In 2019-09, Unilever (which owned Lipton, PG Tips, T2, Tazo, Pure Leaf, and more) published a list of its tea suppliers: https://www.unilever.com/news/press-and-media/press-releases/2019/time-for-tea-unilever-publishes-full-global-list-of-tea-suppliers/

Unilever was known for purchasing roughly 10% of the world's tea supply. Their list of 1261 producers was last updated in 2020-09, and the data are summarized in this chart: https://i.imgur.com/Td6dNsh.png

It's dominated by India at 1008 producers (80%), followed by Bangladesh at 60 (5%) and Sri Lanka at 53 (4%).

In 2021-11, Unilever sold its tea business (under the name ""ekaterra"") to CVC: https://www.cvc.com/media/press-releases/2021/unilever-to-sell-its-tea-business-ekaterra-to-cvc-capital-partners-fund-viii

This sale excluded parts of Unilever's tea business in India, Indonesia, and Nepal where sales were good. So ekaterra buys 5% of the world's tea supply, but it is nevertheless the largest tea company in the world at this time. Their list of 287 producers was last updated in 2020: https://ekaterratea.com/about-tea

**Here are the data**: https://i.imgur.com/ovKTZ63.png

The 60 producers in Bangladesh now represent 21% of ekaterra's portofolio, and the 53 in Sri Lanka constitute 18%. ekaterra got a little bit from India: 43 producers (15%). It also received the 32 producers in Kenya (11%) and the 29 in China (10%).

****

So what does this mean for you? Well, it's hard to say. These producers are used to supply the tea sold by Lipton, PG Tips, etc. Different brands may be affected differently. But in general, we might expect these teabags to become more variable and carry less assam character.

Going forward, ekaterra will likely focus less on black tea (a slow-growing market, which is why Unilever divested from this business) and more on herbals and green tea.

Also note that these are the number of producers in each country -- not the amount of tea from each country. ekaterra likely gets more tea from each producer in Kenya (where it owns many of the plantations) than it does from each producer in, say, China. It's hard to say what's in any given teabag, but this gives us some idea of it.",What's in my teabag? Here are all the producers that Lipton and PG Tips buy from.

Example, are white/green usually sweeter than black or visa versa or is it entirely dependent on how it’s made rather than the leaf?

Side question: Is it generally considered bad to add things like honey to loose leaf tea? I occasionally like to add honey to tisanes, but was curious if that’s common for tea. 

Just to be clear, I plan to try everything the way it comes without honey and even if it’s not a sweet type and really try to taste the flavors.

So coming from a background of just brewing large amounts of black/early grey type teas for myself or multiple people in fairly large mugs, I'm wondering how can you brew larger amounts of tea using a kyusu? Should I just avoid a kyusu and brew more tea at a time if I steep longer per extra oz of water?

I know I can just have hot water ready and just fill a whole kyusu up for one mug if I have to, then refill it again for another, but wouldn't this only work 3ish times before I need to change the leaves? I'd imagine if that is the case I'd be doing a lot of 'labor' and also run out of tea fast.

Also I'm fine with using traditional green tea cups (which I'll likely purchase), but I know I would be refilling them quite a few times so the same question still stands.

I ran across a chai mix (not instant, but a pre-made mix with real spices/tea) that I fell in love with. But it's fairly pricey (I'm sure it's fair for what it is but we're on a budget). :)

The ingredients are simple and few. They are (in order listed):
Tea (they have two options one with black tea, the other with rooibos)
Cinnamon  
Cardamom  
Ginger  
Black Pepper  
Cloves  

They even offer the spice mix without the tea. But I can get the ingredients, even organic, etc for a fraction of the price mixed. The company says that the guy who created this recipe did so from having traveled all around India and used their traditional ingredients and recipes.  
  
I've never tried to recreate a recipe before and I'm having trouble finding a recipe with just these ingredients online.

I want to get more into loose leaf tea and because I like traditional aesthetics, functional design, and hobbies that lend themselves to collecting, I'm looking for a kyusu to start out with and planning in brewing mostly sencha. But I'm finding a lot of confusing information on the ideal size to get.

I get the impression that kyusu run small, but some of the ones I've found that I like are under 150ml which seems ridiculously tiny. My cup alone is 120ml (I am not averse to getting defferent cups of a more appropiate size, though). So, should I aim for a kyusu that will empty in one cup, preventing the leaves from oversteeping? Then if I want more tea I could just make more. Or, should I get a larger one (~300ml) so I have room to share with a friend or 2, and just fill it less if it's just me? Does underfilling affect the flavor? Does size even matter, or just water:leaf ratio? Sorry if this is a lot of questions...

I come seeking your wisdom and aide. I am a Secret Santa for a tea snob and I know next to nothing about tea other than that throat coat tea is wonderful for a cold and we threw a bunch in a harbor to thumb our nose at a king. My limit is $40. Is there anything that I could get that would impress her and, vicariously, my girlfriend's friends? Any guidance or specific recommendations on tea or tea-adjacent items you could give are greatly appreciated.

**Potentially Relevant Details:**

* Bay Area, California
* GF tells me ""Classics are fine (earl grey, oolong, jasmine, darjeeling, etc.) She ordered a strawberry tea at the tea party, so any fruity or citrus tea would be good.""
* Tea party looked very British/Mad Hatter themed.

**Context:**

My girlfriend's friends group does a Secret Santa every year and I've been invited to participate. Unfortunately, I was assigned probably the most difficult person to purchase gifts for. (My girlfriend laughed at me when I told her who my giftee was and said ""Good luck!"") All I know is that she is a big fan of tea and is... fairly particular when it comes to tea and tea accessories. The ladies have attended swanky tea parties before and my giftee has deemed $400 teapots insufficient for her needs. 

A good rule of thumb is to not buy gifts related to a hobby someone is passionate about because you will quite often get it wrong. For example, never buy Beats by Dre for an audiophile. But, since I have no choice, I am determined to get it right and impress her friends with my gift giving acumen. The only problem is that I am out of my depth.

Thank you all ahead of time for your kindness.",Help! I am a Secret Santa for a tea snob.

I'm using teabags since I'm a newbie—pukka elderberry and echinacea, teavana spiced apple cider, and pukka chamomile vanila and manuka honey. They have good reviews online so clearly people enjoy them! 

I use filtered water from the fridge. I bring my water to a boil, warm up my mug with extra water then dump it out, and immediately add it to the teabag. I follow the package instructions of infusing for 10-15 min, depending on the tea. I use less than 8oz of water (so I only fill up my mug halfway basically). I even doubled up on the elderberry one, hoping it would make a difference. 

The teas are always fragrant and colorful (apart from the chamomile which is just yellow), but they dont taste like anything. Just hot water. Is this normal? I have no idea what I could be doing wrong. I really enjoy the aroma of the teas, so I'm still enjoying the experience. The teavana apple cider had the most taste, but it basically tastes like oatmeal to me because the flavors are so subtle and bland lol. 

Is herbal tea just not as flavorful as black tea and other popular teas? Is it just supposed to be fragrant hot water? I plan on investing in higher quality tea in the future, but I'm wondering if this is just how tea tastes.

10563,tea,"Today was my first time trying Turtle Dove from White2Tea. This was a free 7g sample coin included with my puer order.

Turtle Dove is a white tea that is often given as a sample, and is advertised as an easy and forgiving tea, regardless of the brewing method. This sample is either from the 2018 or 2019 batch.

My session stats:
- Tea ratio: 7g/90ml (~1g/13ml)
- Number of infusions: 8
- Infusion rate: 10s/+5s
- Temperature: 212F/100C

First, I rinsed the coin in my teapot with boiling water for 20 seconds to decompress the leaf. I did not taste the rinse tea, but it did smell nice. The first few infusions tasted similar, but the flavor began to mellow out by the fifth infusion.

There was a moderate amount of broken leaf pieces in the pitcher when pouring, but I attribute that to breaking the coin apart to make it fit in my teapot.

I do agree with the notes given by W2T that Turtle Dove has a nice fragrance, body, and mouthfeel.

Since I am still new to gongfu tea, I couldn’t taste any flavor notes, but my initial impression was that this tea reminded me of Lipton tea for some unknown reason, and I don’t even like Lipton tea. I find that strange because this tea is supposed to have sweet flavor notes, but I didn’t taste any sweetness.

My infusions were darker than I had anticipated, not light like a white tea at all, and that is most likely due to my tea ratio and infusion rate, unless this tea is supposed to be darker.

I have never had white tea before, so I didn’t know if the infusion rate should increase during brewing or stay the same. [This](https://imgur.com/a/L0QsY3z) is the color of the sixth infusion, brewed for 35 seconds. All the infusions were similar to this color, including the rinse.

Overall, I wouldn’t order this tea for myself since I didn’t consider it a “great” tea, but I would consider trying it again if I were to get another sample in a future order.

If I made any brewing errors with this tea, feel free to correct me because I do have 25g of Nightlife white tea to try.",Turtle Dove 12/15 novice review

I bought some oolong from them ( [sweet &amp; rich fall pear mountain oolong](https://mountainstreamteas.com/products/pear-mountain-oolongfall-pick?_pos=1&amp;_sid=21e7ebca4&amp;_ss=r) ) and I really loved it! Just wanted to let y'all know they have a [sampler for all 3 harvesting seasons](https://mountainstreamteas.com/collections/light-oolongs/products/all-four-seasons-of-pear-mountain-oolong-sample-pack) and it looks really good! If you enjoy rolled, Taiwanese oolongs I'd definitely recommend it because the fall harvest was amazing! 

Here's a mini review of the sweet oolong and rich oolong from their fall harvest for more context:

Sweet: This one tastes a ton like pear!! The tea is juicy and sweet with a lovely, strong flavor and it's lightly floral. The leaves of both of them are nice and whole and they look beautiful when they unfurl. This tea is a lovely bug bitten tea, which means that it was grown agrochemical free to allow bugs to bite it which makes the leaves sweeter! The color is a nice light yellowish.

Rich: Like the name suggests, this one is much richer, noticeably buttery, but it still holds some of that yummy pear taste! Its broth is a bit darker, but not by much. 

Both of these teas are so good, I can't pick a favorite. Only downside imo is that to really get the best flavor it's best to let them rest for 3-4 weeks after opening before brewing. They're awesome oolongs, so I'm excited to get the 3 season sampler and compare! Anyone else who loves Taiwanese oolongs and is willing to pay a bit for them should check it out to see if it sounds good to them! : ) Just wanted to share, if any of you have had the fall harvest lmk what you thought too!","Super excited to get this cool Taiwanese oolong sampler, wanna tell you all about it for anyone else is really into oolongs : ) + mini review"

I know im using the same temperature of water, because I wrote it down from last time I bought these teas. Im wondering how I should tackle troubleshooting my brews. Should I focus more on experimenting with brew times, or leaf to water ratio? Id say right now im using a 3 or 4 to one water and bud ratio by eyeballing the volume with a 3 to 5 second total brew time

Could this just be a symptom of the buds mellowing out over time in the vendor's storage?

10766,tea,"Hi there! I was wondering if anyone could help me with an issue I'm having. This is really a constant thing kinda but it's a trend I'm noticing with hot teas. I can't really taste alot of them well, they tend to be lightly flavored water, sometimes spicey if it's got cinnamon or ginger n such in the blend, and that's all fine and enjoyable of course, I still like it but I'm starting to feel a lil.... I guess uncertain?

Going off reviews of a blend, my friends opinions and such I feel like I should be getting a much stronger flavor from alot of the brews I try, we all basically brew our teas the same to our knowledge, I used 2-3 heaped teaspoons (About 6 grams) 8 oz of water just off the kettle (usually unless it needs to be a lil cooler for the tea) and brew for the instructed time in my gravity steeper, the last one I brewed being Salted Caramel Lebukchen from bird and blend, yet the most I'm getting from it is a slight gingery spice, despite the fact others seem to be getting more notes from it?

As a better example, Sticky chai, I brewed that multiple ways and despite the fact others got a lot of spicey and sweet notes, I really just got a kind of milky black tea, helped by honey. Now it was nice don't get me wrong it was alright but not what I feel I should be getting from it?

I've noticed when I cold brew (4-6 teaspoons, 16oz i believe, left overnight) I can much much better tastes the flavors I'm looking for, it's alot stronger and usually quite tasty.

I just genuinely cant tell if there's something wrong with my taste buds, if i'm doing something or if i'm maybe expecting too much.

I was considering trying out matcha as I hear that's got a stronger flavor, that and it just seems interesting. 

And also maybe try Gong-fu as I hear that leads to stronger flavors.

I guess this has turned into a bit of a long rant more than a solid question, and probably me overthinking quite a bit about this, but I thought it might be worth posting to see if I can get any input. If anyone could help with their own personal experience or point in the right direction that'd be nice. Sorry for the long rant hahaha.",Can't taste hot tea very well?

10868,tea,"I've been playing around with sencha brewing via American steep style.  The current blend I'm using comes from Harney and Sons and they recommend 1tsp per cup at 175F at 3min for this particular sencha.  I've usually been brewing for around 170F for 2.5min just to see what effects it has on astringency, and not too surprising, more umami, less bitterness.

But recently I found out that 1 cup is not 8oz but rather 6oz for tea which has sorta disrupted this balance and now my brew can sometimes be overpowering with umami.  

My main question is: I know that we should be brewing to preference, but is some level of bitterness/astringency SUPPOSED to be present in order to balance out other flavors?",Sencha: Does astringency balance out umami?

10870,tea,"Today I am reviewing White2tea’s mini 7 gram coin of [2018 Redhead](https://white2tea.com/products/2018-mini-redheads?_pos=5&amp;amp;_sid=68b0a4bf0&amp;amp;_ss=r). 

Mini Redhead is a single serving version of Natural Redhead; a pressed black tea from Yunnan, made in a dianhong style. Made from large leaf varietal material, the tea is sun dried, with no machine processing involved. The tea is smooth, with a very thick body, and a soft natural fragrance.

The coin was 7 grams. 

I love black tea so I couldn’t wait to try it. 

The dry tea smelled very faint. Light sweet earthy-ness 

The wet tea smelled like citrus and cedar. 

100ml of water in a glazed clay giawan. The water was 95 degrees Celsius and I added 10 seconds to each steep. 

I steeped this tea about 30 times. It lasted very long. 

Since it was in coin form it took a while to break down and actually open up. 

The first steep was a rinse to just get the broken leaves out. The second steep was for 30 seconds, just trying to break down the coin. 

The liquor I got from the second steep was very sweet and light. Almost like sugar water. 

By the 3rd steep the coin started to break down and I tasted nice sweetness with a touch of orange flavor. 

Steeps 4-15 got more intense. Super smooth black tea with hints of citrus fruits and sweetness on the back end. 

As the steeps went on I started to taste this type of aged, minerally sweetness that reminded me of aged 2018 Gongmei I have had and reviewed before. 

The one commonality that this black tea and Gongmei share is that they are both sun dried and aged since 2018. Perhaps mineral flavors develops from sun drying. I’m not sure but it’s interesting to think about.  

The mouth feel was very smooth and saturated. 

I didn’t get any astringency or bitterness no matter how hard I pushed the tea. 

The Cha Qi (energy of the tea) was very nice and I mostly felt a rushing in my head. During the later steeps I got a surge of energy that I used to clean my entire apartment lol. 

This was a very nice black tea and I would recommend picking up two cakes of it. One for current drinking and one for further aging. 

I find this black tea approachable for everyone.

10931,tea,"This post reviews two completely different second flush Darjeeling versions, both of which I see as off the most standard style per the type by a bit.  The Everest Orchid version includes some citrus / muscatel range but ventures more into cacao / cocoa, dark cherry, and brandy or wine flavor.  The Rare Muscatel version is much softer in character, and more subtle, including some citrus along with spice and caramel, and a light creamy feel versus the other including more structure.  High bud content black teas can be more subtle; that seems to be the case with the second.

This reminded me of a recent post here about a flavored tea standing out as the best possible black tea version.  Those can be good, but naturally complex flavors are something else, and the variations in interesting feel in higher quality teas adds depth to the experience.  Blended source black teas compensate for flaws or limitations in varying inputs by mixing versions, which trades off distinctiveness and refinement, which can then be compensated for by adding flavoring.

Mind you I'm even more into the general style of Dian Hong, Yunnan black teas, which are easy to turn up in outlets like Yunnan Sourcing.  Those can be pleasant and distinctive even in medium level quality versions,  which typically sell for under $10 for 50 grams.  Often those include sweet and heavy flavors like roasted yam or sweet potato and cocoa / cacao.  Both these Darjeeling are a little more refined than most inexpensive Dian Hong, and would probably cost a bit more, but which aspects or teas are best comes down to preference, with value issues varying by person too.

So I used to work for DavidsTea. I feel like maybe that’s enough said? 😅 I worked with my store manager when we had to close our store and anything on the tea wall, any open bags behind the counter, all of it was expected to get tossed. I say expected but, I don’t actually know if anyone really thought we were all just going to throw away and waste perfectly good tea. I mean we were a small team so it obviously couldn’t all go so quite a bit got tossed which was heartbreaking. But we saved as much as we could. 

There was that on top of, I guess as an apology for the entire situation they gave us a 60% off online code so most of us used that to stock up on things we couldn’t get in the store on closing day. Plus our regular store discount throughout my time there was great. 

We also had a couple of instances where a ton of teas had to get discontinued overnight, and those were also expected to get tossed in the garbage. 

Overall I have a full size bookcase full of tea tins and a whole bin of back up bags of tea.

But then I realized it might be technique, I would pour the entire 1L over the strainer and I was wondering if this large amount of pour over was causing over extraction so today I removed the strainer and poured most of the water in first and then placed the strainer in for the last bit of pour over, now with 3tsp of leaves it tastes mild and somewhat watered down.

From my knowledge, Ti Kuan Yin is a greener oolong with a floral, nutty taste, but the one I purchased looks overly roasted. It's leaves are dark red-brown. To be fair, 6oz was only $7.99 from my local Asian market. Generally even cheaper loose leaves tend to taste better than bags, but in this case when I brewed it, it just tasted overly roasted or almost burned. None of the vegetal or floral notes I had hoped for. I brewed 10oz/300mL with boiling water &amp; 3g of tea for about 4 minutes, and the flavor wasn't very pronounced. Instead of getting stronger with time, it took on a more tin-like taste. Any recommendations on how to brew this tea or at least make it palatable?

I tried making a stronger brew with 1.5tbsp tea for 8oz/240mL water and added 80mL of milk to make a milk tea, but it didn't have much flavor, so I let the tea leaves sit for a couple minutes with the milk. Somehow it got even worse and that same burned tin flavor returned.

I will be trying a (hopefully better) Ti Kuan Yin sample from Adagio soon, but I still want to try to enjoy the tea I bought. Please help! :(",Issues with Ti Kuan Yin &amp; Quality

11094,tea,"I've imported small quantities of green tea from Japan to EU for personal use. I recently ran into an issue with customs needing a phytosanitary certificate for importing green tea since 2019. This is not available from the vendor, because it usually shouldn't be needed for importing tea. The certificate is expensive, and needs an in-person inspection. I've been buying tea from [Yunomi.life](https://Yunomi.life)

Has anyone else ran into similar issues in recent years, and any advice if there's any way to import green tea without phytosanitary certificates?

I could look at buying from local importers, but from what I understand they will have the same limitations, so this will severely reduce the types of green tea available to buy in EU. I've been enjoying tea from smaller Japanese tea producers, who will not be able to comply with the regulation, and there's no legal way to import those types of teas now it seems.

I don't understand why green tea is being held to a similar standard as living plants or seeds in the EU regulation. Black tea and coffee are specifically exempt from needing the certificate, and green tea is a processed, heat-treated and dried product, so does it really have a bigger disease risk than black tea? Some of the more general info I've found on the regulation also say that tea in general should be exempt, but green tea specifically is not considered exempt and does need the certificate.

Below is the regulation I've looked at. It specifically mentions 09021000 and 09022000 categories "" Tea leaves, fresh, whole, not cut, not fermented, not flavoured"" as needing the certificate. 30 and 40 are for black tea, and do not require one.

11170,tea,"I received this tea as part of the White2tea September tea club. 

I have had Gongmei from White2tea before. The one I had was 2013 and was very good. Can definitely taste the age. 

Since this Gongmei was not aged as much it was still bright and floral while also having depth and some of that aged flavor. 

The dry tea smelled like damp flowers and grass. 

The wet tea smelled like burnt raisins and molasses. 

I steeped this tea gong fu cha style (7 grams of tea, 100 milliliters of water) about 25 times. It lasted very long. 

The first 7 steeps I steeped with 90 degrees Celsius water. Started at 20 seconds and added 10 seconds with each steep. 

The first 7 steeps were very pleasant. Tasted and smelled floral with some wet wood notes in the background. The smell of the gong dao bei was sweet and floral. The entire room started to smell sweet. 

After the 7th steep I pushed this tea super hard to see if I can tip the scales to the other side. No longer wanted to get sweetness but now wanting to taste the age. 

Every steep from the 7th steep was with boiling water and steeped for over 3 minutes. I added a minute each steep. 

I found this to be my favorite version of the tea. When pushed with boiling water and steeped for minutes the tea became crimson red and the mouth feel was smooth and syrup like. I tasted deep raisins and dates and got this super medicinal mineral back note. 

It was very good and very interesting. No bitterness. Not astringency. This tea can be brewed any way and it will be enjoyable. 

The cha qi (feeling of the tea) was very calming and relaxing. Almost like a warm hug from an old friend.

11242,tea,"So tea is basically my favorite drink. I need something to sip on to help throughout the day, and have a nice hot drink like tea has been perfect for this. I have a lot of tea but it's always just been your basic Tetley tea bags. I recently discovered my favorite tea, much to my surprise is McDonald's orange pekoe, small (since they don't double up bags for larger sizes), with a tiny bit of sugar. This made me interested in seeing if I could find and brew better tea at home. 

So I purchased a vadham loose leaf black tea sampler pack (10 types, link here https://www.amazon.ca/Black-Teas-Loose-Leaf-Sampler/dp/B016KQXYZA) since my preference is black tea over the herbal/green stuff. I have not enjoyed a single one of the samplers. They're just okay at best. They don't have much flavor, and it's taken a LOT of practice and experimenting (along with some googling) to get any half okay cups but it still doesn't really taste that good to me. The only decent one to me was the Earl grey, which was a huge surprise to me cause I really hated the McDonald's Earl grey bagged tea. The English breakfast one was okay, and the rest were pretty terrible. Blooming rose looked cool and smelled nice at least I guess. The the Darjeeling tasted like.some weird in between green tea. The rest was just tasteless and bland. 

I've tried various combinations of different combinations of steeping times, heat, tea quantity, etc. What worked best for me was to use more leaves, toss it in the strainer then give a shake to get smaller pieces out, giving it a little wash, bringing water to a boil in a saucepan, then putting the heat all the way down. I toss it in for 3 minutes, take it off the stove, let it brew for another minute or two off the stove depending on how strong the type of tea is, then I pour it through the strainer into my cup. This was as close as I could get to a decent cup 100 grams of loose leaf tea later. However it still tasted too bland and tasteless, and brewing it any more or adding even more leaves made it taste too bitter, even if I try to balance it out with some sugar. I'm bamboozled how the McDonald's bagged tea is able to balance having a strong tea taste without the bitterness. Did I just have bad tea leaves? I also bought yuunan loose leaf tea on an impulse afterwards while doing grocery at an Asian grocery store. No idea what brand it is but I thought the red tin looked fancy and ppl on Reddit said it tastes good. This was a bit of a mistake but I won't blame the tea for this one, it's just way too pungent smelling for me to enjoy. I blame myself for not doing a little more research before purchasing. 

Anyways, where can I find better (reasonably priced) tea, or how can I brew better tea? I think at this point I should stop trying to navigate tea on my own or I'm just gonna keep getting bad tea then end up back at McDonald's bagged tea lol.",Trying to get into tea but my experience so far with loose leaf has been pretty bad

For a quick background, i’ve always liked black or green iced teas for years, however I’d drink it unhealthily sweet. As of lately, I’ve been getting into unsweetened sleepytime tea to help relax in the evening, something my mom showed me recently. The chamomile taste is pretty tasty/soothing, and the one I have has a small amount of valerian added.

11297,tea," This post is inspired by a recent post on this sub about “just really liking tea”  ([https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/r1w1ru/does\_anyone\_else\_here\_just\_really\_like\_tea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/r1w1ru/does_anyone_else_here_just_really_like_tea/)).

Some people might just be happy to have teabags in a mug, and that’s ok. Some other people might be curious about exploring tea in more depth, but might be intimidated by all the “bells and whistles”. So I thought it would be helpful to say what is and isn’t needed to explore tea in more depth.

First of all, you don’t need a lot of complicated tools. Things like tea pets, clay teapots, and pitchers are not necessary. Kettles with many buttons or temperature control are not necessary.

You do need to pay attention to what you are drinking (What is the taste and texture? How does it make you feel?). You also need to pay attention to the way the things you do (e.g. how long you steep) change the result.

In terms of equipment, you only need a simple kettle, a tool to make tea, and a cup/mug.

If you’re used to tea bags in a mug, this is the only thing that might feel a bit complicated: as the tool to make tea, I recommend using a porcelain gaiwan. But you’ll see that you get used to it really quickly, it is easy to learn how to use it. With a porcelain gaiwan, you can steep loose leaf tea - no teabags also means less trash! And you don’t need a strainer (there’s one less thing to wash). A porcelain gaiwan is cheap (\~$10 for a factory made one, \~$40 for handmade), but it does well with any kind of tea, from the cheaper ones to the very expensive ones. It pours really fast, so it gives you more control on how long you steep than a teapot.

Then you get different kinds of teas, try to steep them for different amounts of time and with different amounts of leaf, and adjust until you like what comes out.",You don't need complicated tools to explore tea

Dear Reddit Tea Drinkers,

‘My name is Andrew and while I run an online tea company, please view everything here as separate from that. This is part of a personal project of mine to expand and help develop a growing community by providing access to a wide range of first hand experience with the thing called puerh.’

A little bit of background here, in college I had bought some puerh on Ebay and brewed it for three minutes at the café. Immediate shared hatred on Steepster as a review. Quickly I was sent samples to cover a wider spread of puerh taste as well as information on how to brew. Since then I have been paying it forward under my own belief that puerh is something that a person needs to try quite a few different examples of but it becomes intimidating to go on a site with a lack of information when it comes to harvest, storage, leaf type, village names, and on. So six years ago I decided to send starter packs out for free. This eventually became something I couldn’t just do myself so I opened up for people to help out and you all can guess what happened. The tea community, being the best out there, supplied me with puerh to send across the world!

As of 2020 this project has helped provide an introduction exploration of puer to over 700+ people over 50+ countries. A beautiful thing that has been made possible to continue with thanks to the community. Because of some people, the material (puerh) to do this on such a wide scale not only comes from my self but people donate to contribute for you all! 

So if this seems like it’s something for you, over the last five years as a collective group the tea community has advised me to make a small $5.00 charge for materials, time, and some tea. As much as I'd love to just send things out free, I was convinced this was best and have continued to keep it as such.

Two places to get in on this:

\*If you feel as if you cannot afford this, please let me know. We have sponsors who have paid for people’s packages already. As of the time that I am writing this, there’s easily 20 packages that will be free. Please drop a comment below so I can get with you about this!

This is meant for those who are new to puerh or had a bad experience to which they didn’t return.

Appreciate everyone who took the time to read through this, anyone who shares their experience, anyone whose donated to help out, and anyone whose joining this year!

Thank-you for allowing me to continue and pump positivity into this community. Looking forward to seeing people discover the pleasures that come with puerh this upcoming winter 😊

I received this sample of tea from the July package of white2tea’s monthly tea club. I really like the quality and variety of their monthly tea club and I think it’s worth the $30 a month. I would recommend it if you are looking for a tea club. 


July’s package had two samples of the same type of tea, Sheng Pu’er. Both very similar with differences so you can try both side by side and find out what you really like. 

Both were from the same region and both stored since 2013 but in different ways. This review is only going to be about one of the teas “2013 Not GFZ”. If you want a review of the other tea let me know. 

This tea has been called “Not GFZ” because the tea seller does not have a lot of information about the tea but the inner ticket said “Guafengzhai” which is a very famous village where tea is thousands of dollars. He suspected that this is not true “Guafengzhai” tea but the tea ticket might be fake which happens sometimes when buying Sheng Pu’er’s. That is why he named it “Not GFZ”. Nevertheless the quality of the tea is still very good. Although there a long stems and very few buds. 

I steeped this tea gong fu cha style with boiling water about 20 times. It lasted for a pretty long time and I very much enjoyed the session. 

I would not recommend brewing this tea western style because of how strong it would be. 

The flavor of the tea was sweet, earthy, medicinal and old. After swallowing there was a lingering sweetness and a little dryness and astringency that made the mouth water a little. No matter how hard I pushed it I could not get any bitterness out of it. This was a very sweet Sheng Pu’er. 

The mouthfeel of the tea was smooth. Not velvety or thick. Just smooth. 

The body feel of the tea or the “Cha Qi” was very nice. It was mostly in the head for me. A great rush of energy and clarity in the mind. Great alertness and mood enhancing. This tea gave me great energy and made me want to dance. 

All in all this was a very solid tea and I am going to be ordering more. I very much enjoyed this gong fu cha session. 

9/10 

Let me know if you guys have any questions or if you want more of these reviews. 

Thanks,

11463,tea,"Hi all, 

So I am hoping to buy a tea sampler of some sort for my mom this Christmas. The goal is to give her something she can turn back to through out the dark and colder winter. I began my search on Amazon and quickly got overwhelmed. I'd see something with good reviews, then quickly find less good reviews from r/tea's more discerning palates. I know next to nothing about tea, and my mom loves it. Therefore I don't want to just pick a random sampler.

I'd like to get looseleaf tea and she tends to prefer herbal teas and green teas (Jasmin pearl is her favorite for what that is worth). 

I totally don't expect anyone to spend time telling me exactly which item to buy, but if you could suggest your favorite brands or brands you know to be of high quality, I'd really really appreciate it!

11464,tea,"I'm pretty new to loose-leaf teas, so apologies in advance if this is an odd question. 

I currently brew my tea Western-style in a pretty big (for me) teapot. I'm just brewing for myself, and I like to brew about 6 oz at a time (enough to fill my teacup). 

However, my teapot is a bit big for this amount, and hard to clean since I prefer to ditch the infuser when I make oolongs, for example. I want to get a different pot, and I really like the concept of the gaiwan itself as it seems much simpler, less cumbersome and easier to clean, but at the moment I'm not super interested in brewing gongfu style (more leaf, shorter steep times, tons of steeps, etc). 

So, while I definitely might get more interested in gongfu later on, I do want to know: is brewing Western-style something you can do in a gaiwan, i.e. smaller amount of leaf, more water and longer steeping times as you would in a teapot? I know the gaiwan isn't ""made"" for it, but would it give a similar result to teapot brewing, or is there something about the structure of the gaiwan that would create a problem for the brewing process or resulting tea if brewed this way? 

Thanks!",Western-style in a gaiwan?

Or is this something that I have to account for myself? So if it says ""brew at 90 °C"" should I bring my water to 95 °C so it'll brew at 90 °C in the vessel?

And if the latter is the case, what do I do with teas that ask for 99 °C or 100 °C, like Pu Erhs and Oolongs? My kettle only goes up 100 °C, so the highest brewing temperature I can achieve is 95 °C.",A question about temperature control.

I have two main questions other than comments and further suggestions.

1. Is the ""First Steps Tea Sampler"" worth it, or am I better served by hand picking another handful of individual teas?

2. Is is worth getting both Duck Shit varieties below, or is the flavor ""close enough"" to get just one. I read notes here on the Snowflake and how creamy it was and then added it, but not sure if the differentiation is notable enough from the Kind of Duck Shit.

11558,tea,"a picture here of a Russian samovar (brewing device) led me to wanting to share some background on how brewing with those works out.  I'm not an expert, and not even Russian, but only partly related to visiting Russia I ended up talking to a lot of Russians about tea themes for a long time.  this photo is from a dogsled camp in the Murmansk area, with a mixture of tea and herbs brewing in that.  the second picture is from mid-afternoon there, when it was already pitch black outside, due to the ""polar night"" theme.

that's a main point, that tea can be drank as a mix of black tea and also herbs brewed that way, then diluted to a preferred strength by adding water, since long term brewing leads to the tea being strong.  I would imagine that using willow herb (Ivan chay, fireweed) would be as common as anything else, which is a great pairing for drinking with tea, mild but along a similar line in character.  drinking mixes of herbs or other herbs is part of a longstanding Russian tradition, which is common in Eastern Europe too.

one of the most interesting parts another friend mentioned was about ""prison tea,"" using tea as a drug, brewed so strongly that it has a different effect.  another interesting part is about drinking tea mixed with jam.  it could seem odd from a different cultural perspective but it makes perfect sense.  Russia's oldest tea tradition came from exposure to Chinese trade, then when that faltered it was sourced from other places, in modern times often from Sri Lanka.  Georgia produced a lot of the tea made in the USSR (the country), then the Georgian tea industry reset after the fall of the Soviet Union.  tea is made in Russia now, in the Sochi area, and some is pretty good.  new forms and styles of tea coming out of Georgia are really nice too.  Chinese tea culture and Chinese teas are the main theme among Russian tea enthusiasts again today, renewed back in the 1990s.  I write about all these themes in the Tea in the Ancient World blog but this is about sharing these particular ideas, not promoting that.

11571,tea,"Hello all. First post here. Brief background. 

Friend got me into oolong and pu’er tea. He wasn’t super knowledgeable but he got me into it. I just learned to use an adagio “ingenuitea” plastic French press style steeper for loose tea. Never got into the real clay/gongfu tea ceremony. Love tea, just draw the line somewhere. At least for now. 

So here is my predicament. How does a rookie who doesn’t want to do hours of research make sure they are getting quality tea? Is there a gold standard online supplier that is extremely trustworthy? I’m not trying to buy tea that is $40 for two ounces. Also not trying to get scammed and end up with some Lipton. 

I have only purchased “real oolong” from mountain tea dot com. I think the rules say I’m not allowed to link to them. They have been a decent supplier. I have learned that my palate prefers dark and medium oolong. I have sinus issues so a lot of faint tastes are lost on me. Not a big fan of “extremely nuanced and insanely delicate” notes. 

Their imperial Pearl oolong and their TGY are both great, in my relatively rookie opinion. 

So I’m almost out of tea. I only buy about $50-$100 every year for the short Arizona winter. Would love some recommendations. Also, have had some pu’er like I mentioned. I believe the “shu” variety is the one I preferred. Not trying to commit to one massive brick, but also not trying to get some junk off eBay.

I drink tea a lot but usually just make one cup at a time but sometimes will make a few in close enough time that investing in a tepot seems like a good idea.

This tea found its way to me and I am trying to find out what it is, so that I can prepare it properly.

So far, I have only been able to find out that it's probably some kind of pu-erh.

The tea is really hard (almost like a small rock), but can be split in half with some strength. When I prepare it in the style of pu-erh, it gives the smell of chicken stock and tastes like very soft pu-erh (the earthy tones are way softer). It is not the ""instant pu-erh"", this tea does not dissolve and the leaves start to unwind after \~3rd pour.

What I did do though is got a few different kinds of tea.

I also picked up the CS Sleepytime tea, which I absolutely fell in love with. I find myself looking forward to my night time tea. However, I don't drink it during the day because well, obvious reasons.

Anyway, today I went to the store and picked up some bags of Bigelow green tea and some loose leaf Lipton tea. Lipton you say? Yeah. Fight me.

The Lipton turned out pretty fucking bad, but it was literally the only loose leaf tea in town so I did what had to be done. Anyway, I brewed the tea at 100° Celsius and let it steep for about 4 minutes and 30-45ish seconds. 

I nearly shat my pants when I took a sip. She was bitter. I'm a man though, so there was no milk or sugar to be added. It really wasn't so bad after that initial jolt but as the cup cools next to me it's getting worse. 

I have yet to try the green tea but will be soon. I'm planning on ordering some ""good"" green/black loose leaf tea online.

11891,tea,"I wrote a review of a compressed tisane blend compressed bar, along with reviewing a Da Hong Pao oolong mixed with willow herb, also called fireweed or Ivan Chay.  These are from a Russian producer, Moychay, which ties to tisanes being more popular in Russia and Eastern Europe than in most other places.  Willow herb might be the most popular tisane from there.  The ""Caucasus blend"" is one of the best blends of tisanes I have yet to try, and supposedly was made in consultation with an herbalist (but who knows about all that).  Mint, floral and fruit tones, and warmer spice like sage really balanced well.

I guess the Da Hong Pao (Wuyishan oolong) and willow herb worked.  They are comparable flavor ranged themes, both warm toned, complex, often including some fruit, or in other cases just warm spice range instead, with mineral undertones.  It's a little odd to mix real tea and tisanes, eliminating the potential goal of avoiding caffeine intake, but I've been doing a little of that myself, drinking sheng pu'er with other herbs that are around to make ""grandpa style"" or tea bottle brewing work out.

These bar versions are nice for being inexpensive; they cost around $4, for 50 grams.  They could easily brew 2 or 3 large cups each from the ""candy bar style"" sections the bars are pressed into.  Tisanes / herb teas should be inexpensive, since that material doesn't cost a lot, but for this kind of novel and positive blending and presentation approach it seems like higher pricing might be normal.

What piqued my curiosity was that [this site](https://www.lomonosov-russia.com/) claims to be a factory direct distributor, but not listed with IPM-JSC. Directly contacting the factory-direct site, they claim to be an official distributor since 1996. Has anyone purchased from these guys/someone familiar with Russian porcelain able to validate this claim? 

Thank you very much!",Validating the authenticity of Lomonosov distributor(s)?

\- I am mostly a solo drinker. Usually a 300ml teapot would suffice

\- However I brew flower tea sometimes, and I like to put the remaining tea in the fridge to be consumed as cold tea. Is this teapot good for this purpose?

\- With most teapots the volume it states in the description does not reflect the actual volume you can fill in the teapot. I assume you don't fill the teapot to the brim, so you aren't really getting 700ml out of a 700ml teapot. Is it better to go for a bigger teapot for this reason?

\- Also I wonder, if it's okay to just brew just 300ml in a 700ml teapot? Will it affect the taste? 

\-With a larger teapot I assume I can be more flexible with the tea I want to make. I can make fruit tea for example.

Background:

I was a pretty avid coffee drinker. I would usually brew a pot in the morning and drink it during the day until about 2pm. My wife and I went through a lot of anxiety inducing trauma earlier this year and the general angst was really messing with my life. I would drink coffee during the day and a beer or two at night to relax and calm down. It was wreaking havoc on my blood pressure, sleep, skin, and general well being. I knew that it was time to start making healthier changes, so the first one was to replace coffee with Tea. I didn't know ANYTHING about tea, but I knew the generic statement ""tea is healthy"". So I just swapped it out with a loose leaf black tea (H&amp;S). And here we are, a month later.

The Feels:

So the first week was hard as I swapped out my caffeine dependency but even in the afternoons, I felt significantly better.

The second week was better and at the end of the second week, I swapped out alcohol for tisanes. It was at this point that I got my first night of sleep without thrashing about and waking up several times during the night.

Week three was when I felt like I was losing my caffeine dependency. I've been able to move away from high caffeine teas without noticing anything. I felt like I was finally able to drink the teas I wanted without feeling the consequence of having too little caffeine. 

Week four - After looking back over the last month, I've seen a significant difference to the way I feel. I have clarity and focus in the afternoons (normally my focus would be SHOT around 1pm). My skin is more clear. I've been able to sleep consistently at night and haven't felt my heart 'flutter' in a month. Oh, and my BREATH is WAY BETTER. The most surprising thing is that my mouth feels noticeably fresh all day long. I'm not scared to talk to people anymore. Lol. Oh, and my hands feel better. I'm a programmer and my hands normally get fatigued by the end of the day, but in drinking tea (maybe because of the hydration?), I have noticed that my hands just ""feel better"". It's hard to describe but it's noticeable because of my job.

I don't think that tea is 100% the reason that these things have happened, but replacing coffee and alcohol with tea absolutely has made a difference in my general well being. I really don't want to give the impression that I'm advertising anything but I want to share my story with you all. I felt like I was falling into that lifestyle of sluggishness so typical of many Americans but as of today, I feel so much better. Now, I'm deep in the rabbit hole of tea. I'll post about what I've learned next time. XD

I would absolutely love to hear your stories.",Today marks 30 days since I've replaced coffee with tea. Here's how I feel so far.

Then the next person comes in and repeats the process. With the same used teabag.

*Tea Gardens and New Intoxicants in Early Modern London*, given by James Brown (University of Sheffield) 

[Event &amp; booking link](https://www.history.ac.uk/events/tea-gardens-and-new-intoxicants-early-modern-london)

11 November 2021, [5:30PM - 7:00PM (UTC)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Tea+Gardens+and+New+Intoxicants+in+Early+Modern+London&amp;iso=20211111T1730&amp;p1=%3A&amp;ah=1&amp;am=30)

Drawing on diaries, travel accounts, legal records, trade cards, and  visual culture – and inspired by the attempts of present-day eating and  drinking establishments to create or adapt outdoor consumption spaces in  response to the COVID-19 pandemic – this paper explores the social and  cultural world of the tea garden in early modern London, especially as a  site for the retail, exchange, and consumption of ‘new’ intoxicants  (especially tea, coffee, and tobacco). While largely ignored in recent  historiography in favour of the larger pleasure gardens (especially  Vauxhall and Ranelagh) and the indoor settings of alehouse, coffeehouse,  tavern, and inn, the paper argues that c.100 metropolitan tea gardens,  many of them in semi-rural settings on the outskirts of the city, were  central to the circulation of new intoxicating substances and their  assimilation into the habits and diets of early modern Londoners: by  creating a viewing platform for the conspicuous consumption of  fashionable new commodities; by promoting conceptual associations  between new intoxicants and good health; and by offering botanical  settings for the enjoyment of plant-based tropical staples. Often  attached to inns and taverns, tea gardens were also venues for the  consumption of traditional intoxicants in the form of ale, beer, wine,  and spirits, and were therefore hybridised consumption spaces in which,  characteristically, old and new intoxicants cross-fertilised and  overlapped.","Free online seminar tomorrow - ""Tea Gardens and New Intoxicants in Early Modern London"", with James Brown (University of Sheffield)"

12028,tea,"So I have some Darjeeling  FTGFOP1 that I wanted to try out and my experience has been odd.

Most teas I drank general have a predominant note that doesn't change and nuances that change depending on how you prepare it and what you mix in this. 

This tea, however, seems to change its predominant note depending on what you mix with it.

So my experience with it plain is that it smells and tastes like eggplant juice. I just didn't like it plain, as simple as that.

So I decided to try some variations, from the same batch I made, brewed as indicated by the providers instructions - same amount of sugar in all of them:

I mixed in sugar - It turned into this complex vegetal drink akin to a deeper green tea that honestly surprised me. It also highlighted a sweetness that I didn't even notice with it plain.

I decided to try some spelt milk and sugar - A powerful feel of creaminess emerged. It was almost close to whipped cream in feel and taste but far less sweet. A slight note of muskiness emerged this way.

I decided to try some sugar and lemon - It turned into this unusual flavor that I don't even know how to describe but it was pleasant and slightly sweet, with few vegetal tones. 

For comparison, my Assam's TGFOP1 Second Flush malt flavor sticks regardless of the variation, but this tea seems to change like a chameleon depending on the variation.

I do really like homemade iced tea and bottled green tea, so I'm pretty sure its just a me thing. Yesterday, I tried chamomile tea (6oz boiled water, steeped for over 5 mins, 2 packets of Splenda) and I liked it! I got really excited. If I am intentional about how I make it (ie boiling the water instead of just using the Kuerig to make hot water) I think I can add tea into my drink routine.

**Note: there's a** [**long-form version**](https://blog.vistontea.com/how-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-tea/) **of this post if you want more detailed insights.**

We're all fans of tea here on /Tea subreddit and most of us have our tips to make the best-tasting cup of tea. Because tea is gaining in popularity, and there's a lot of novice tea lovers, I wanted to share my tips to get the most out of the drink. So without further ado, here they are.

# Tip #1: Learn the basic preparation instructions

Tea preparation follows a set of general steps, so it’s necessary to learn them first. They are the following:

1. Heat up your water in a kettle.
2. Put tea leaves into the teapot.
3. Pour hot water on the leaves.
4. Wait a few minutes for the tea to steep.
5. Add milk or sugar, if you want.
6. Drink the tea hot.

Everything else is mostly variations on these steps and tweaking certain parameters like water used to brew tea, temperature, steeping time, and more.

# Tip #2: Use loose-leaf tea

Low-quality leaves won’t make good tea. Sure, tea bags are convenient, but they may have certain health concerns with all the [plastics](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/30/those-fancy-tea-bags-nylon-microplastics-in-them-are-macro-offenders) and other potentially toxic elements. Also, it's almost impossible to find tea bags that match the quality of loose-leaf tea, because they mostly contain ground-up tea leaves or tea dust - basically leftover tea.

# Tip #3: Use fresh water

Tea is only as good as the water used to prepare it. Water loses minerals every time it's boiled, so not to boil the same water twice. Also, make sure your water isn't hard, which is sometimes the case with tap water. Otherwise, your tea can look muddy and taste stale.

# Tip #4: Get the temperature and steeping time right

If your tea tastes bitter - bad temperature or over-steeping may be the cause. Not every tea needs boiling water. The temperatures and steeping times largely depend on the type of tea you drink. Here's a handy reference you can use:

[Guidelines for water temperatures and steeping times of different types of teas](https://preview.redd.it/hnv9phc5lcy71.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8c29050a60aff158c60696e5755202816b64a6e)

# Tip #5: Remove tea leaves when drinking

After the recommended steeping time is passed, nothing good is being added to the tea anymore. If you leave the tea leaves or a tea bag in the cup while drinking, you're basically over-steeping your tea. Use a teapot and pour the tea into the cup, or remove the leaves from the cup - use a strainer.

# Tip #6: Store your tea correctly

Tea loses its freshness and absorbs smells if it's stored incorrectly. It should be stored in an air-tight container, like a can or a sealed bag. And no, **the cardboard box the tea bags came in is not good enough.** Only some pu'erh teas may be stored openly, but even then, keep the tea away from strong smells. Generally, a kitchen cupboard is a perfect place to store your tea.

# Tip #7: Learn about what’s in your cup of tea

If you're on this subreddit, chances are you're already teaching yourself about tea. Keep it up! Tea world is incredibly large, and opening yourself up to it will bring many great experiences. Surely everyone can discover at least some type of tea that they'll love.

# Final thoughts

So, here are my seven tips for the perfect cup of tea. If you're a beginner, I hope that this can be the perfect starting point for your tea journey. 

If there's only one tip that will make your tea taste better instantly, it's - stop using tea bags. I hope you found this post useful. If you did - **upvote this post** so that more people can improve their tea drinking experience.

12112,tea,"I start with a 30-ounce insulated stainless steel tumbler. I add two ""family-sized"" tea bags, then pour 15-16 ounces of boiling water over the tea bags. I place the lid on the tumbler, preserving the heat, and let the tea steep for about 4 1/2 minutes. I remove the tea bags, being careful not to let them drain long into the tea. I immediately add ice to fill the tumbler, until it is full.

When the temperature stabilizes, nearly all of the ice has melted, but the tea is ice cold, and the insulated tumbler keeps it that way long enough to drink the tea.

I've been very pleased with the results. The only thing that requires regular cleanup is the tumbler, and it gets quickly cleaned prior to each new cup, while the kettle is heating. The tea is as good as I can expect  from tea bags, strong but not bitter, and every glass is freshly brewed.

I'm using Luzianne tea bags, plus filtered water in the kettle and for ice, but it seems to be the stainless steel insulated tumbler that makes everything work so well. It keeps the water hot during steeping and the tea cold while drinking. It also keeps cleanup to a minimum and forces me to brew fresh tea 2-3 times daily.

The best part is that I've swapped sugared soda for unsweet tea as the preferred beverage in my diet.",I found *my* perfect iced tea brewing method. (YMMV)

However, it comes with a decent ceramic bowl, which seems like is sturdier and can maintain heat better than a regular bowl.

Alternatively, I could buy a pricier scoop + whisk set online (e.g. [this one](https://www.stmatcha.com.au/product-page/matcha-set-essential-light-bamboo)) but I'd have to use a random ceramic bowl at home or something instead, which might affect the matcha whisking and final output?

I know his dad, but the owner of the tea shop he worked at died around 10 years ago and the new one wasn't very nice, so he switched to selling/buying in other areas before I got to know him, so it never came up.
Fast forward, the night got late and my friend moved recently, but his childhood home was nearby, so we crashed there for the night.
Today, during breakfast, I asked his dad about tea and we talked for an hour and a half about quality, sourcing, pesticides etc. Then he just gets up, pulls some high grade matcha out of the cupboard and makes me the best cup of tea I've ever had!

However after a few days, I've found its effectiveness has worn off a bit and doesn't help as well. I've tried a few things like increasing steeping time and reducing amount of water that the tea bag was steeped in, which did make for a slight improvement but not quite enough.

I like the way that green tea feels but want to increase the amount of green tea and/or its effectiveness. I tried white tea and it gave a bigger initial hit but wasn't as calming and sustained as I found green tea was so I'd prefer to work with that.

I'm sensitive to caffeine at higher levels (due to medication) so I want to gradually increase the amount of caffeine that I have in my tea (e.g. going from one green teabag to two would be too big a jump, I'd like to increase by 25-50% rather than 100%).

My current ideas were to either switch to loose leaf green tea (to be able to directly measure how much tea) or to just add a tiny bit of coffee or pre-workout to my green tea from a teabag.

From his description, it was relatively big, double layer clear glass teapot that could be put directly on the stove for making loose leaf tea. He also mentioned it had a good quality spout that didn't drip.

[https://nioteas.com/products/fukamushicha-yamaga?\_pos=1&amp;\_sid=c9b29460d&amp;\_ss=r#description](https://nioteas.com/products/fukamushicha-yamaga?_pos=1&amp;_sid=c9b29460d&amp;_ss=r#description) 

My kyusu is 350 ml capacity and I am using about 150-200 ml. Is it possible the temp is going down instantly despite pre warming? Not sure if this will make any sense, but it almost seems like since using a kyusu that I'm not ""steeping"" the teas enough or being too ""gentle"". This seems to be the only explanation for why the richness and cloudiness isnt being extracted. 

I did 67C for 1 minute, which is pretty standard. Even if I had done 70C I dont think the end result would have been that different. 

PS-- the tea tasted great, the visual appearance is just strange. The fukamushichas ive had in the past from another company have yielded that deep green color.",Why arent my Fukamushicha senchas yielding their typical dark green cloudy color?

Several days ago I had the pleasure to enjoy an Elaichi chai from a humble Indian café/restaurant. I didn't witness the preparation since it was done in the kitchen, but from what I've briefly read online, chai in India is most commonly prepared with low-grade bagged Assam (presumably for reasons of convenience and easy access?). Interestingly, I read that an advantage to tea bags is that they can stand up to the strength of the spices ([source](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/masala-chai-history-recipe-article)).  

I have the option of stopping by a tea shop next week to pick up some loose leaf Assam ([this one](https://www.citizentea.com/shop/tea/black-tea/assam-banaspaty-organic/)); alternatively I can head to an Indian grocery store for tea bags next time I visit my boyfriend's town.  

Note that I don't plan on making Masala chai (I haven't acquired the taste for the use of peppercorns in Masala yet), just cardamom and possibly some ground ginger and nutmeg. I don't plan to boil the chai on my stovetop, rather just prepare the tea in my mug with the spices thrown in while it steeps. If any of this is worth considering.

As a NOOB. What is the best way to start collecting my new loose tea supplies. I have noticed some websites that also sell loose leaf. (Is it better to go into your local tea shop and buy from them, even though you don't know how long its been sitting on the shelf)? I live in an area that there are not that many to choose from unless I drive into Los Angeles, CA.

Or are there some reputable loose tea websites this group can recommend. Many sites sell in grams so I have to do the calculation to see how oz. qty I am getting for the price. I do not mind going off their tasting notes and see what I like: But can anyone recommend their go to websites for loose leaf? Please recommend some sites that you trust and maybe even some starting tea that you trust so I can put in an order.

Sidenote: I use the Chefman 1.8L Digital Precision Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser (currently, in images). Is this a good way to infuse my tea, or is there a more advanced preferred method?

I have heard from some tea shops that use 2 tbsp. of loose per 20 oz. of water (my mug size). I do not know if this amount per water is correct. I see some that use # of tsp. per measure. Any thoughts on ratio of loose to amount of water.

Thanks for listening to my rant.

I found that the taste of the Chenpi is too strong compared with the Pu'er. It overshadows it. I don't know if this is how it is supposed to taste like? The taste of the Chenpi seems to go out faster than the Pu'er in boiling water, but Pu'er also needs hot water and long steep time. So there is a dilemma here. Also, the Chenpi is not a good tea bag, so it seems to prevent the tea from spreading. 

I wonder if it is better to take the tea out of it instead? 

Here is my first try:

Near boiling, \~488ml water in a hot cup, steeped for 8 minutes, no lid. 

Result: Can't really taste the Pu'er

12555,tea,"Hi everyone,

A few years ago I started in the world of tea and little by little I have been increasing both my knowledge and my teaware and my stash with more and better (I think) teas.

Everything I have been learning has been between self-taught, youtube videos, reddit, blogs and articles. I started from the tea bags to where I am now with the gong fu.

In this way I have been improving and noticing the differences between the different types of tea, even the differences between the varieties of the same type. What I feel that I am not able to do is get as many notes of flavors and smells as I can see in posts and videos.

I don't know if the problem is me or the teas I have (maybe they are not of sufficient quality?). I have been increasing the quality of the tea that I buy over time, every time I invest more because I want more quality, so I think the problem is that I cannot train my palate to get these notes.

For this reason I've decided I want to try making my own tea tray.

First of all, I'd like to see if I'm missing anything important conceptually. Essentially, it's a hollow box with a lid that can be slid open to the side or simply lifted and has holes for water to drain through. Many modern trays have plastic containers in the bottom to catch the drip.
Correct so far or is there anything I'm missing?

As for material, bamboo seens traditional and cheap,  a nice wood seems like the obvious choice for something to look at. Any suggestions here?
I've seen metal drain-lids which are likely very durable, but can anyone share experiences? My concern is that they would sound rather harsh when placing teaware on top.

Lastly, there's the design. I own a 40w lasercutter, so I'll likely be able to cut an intricate design into the lid, however I want to keep it simple yet beautiful.

Planning to place a big-ish order soon, and wanted to save a bit of money on the shipping. Would it be worth it to get SAL instead of EMS?

But if EMS will bring it here in say, 2 weeks, while SAL would bring it here in 10, I'd rather just spend the extra $30.

I bought some to bring home as well as picking up a tea pot and infuser. However, I'm having a hard time getting the flavor to be as strong as it was when I first tasted (it had an amazingly strong buttery taste).

On the link above they do provide steps on how to prepare it but I must be doing something wrong.  Here is what I'm doing, please tell me what I'm doing wrong or what I can try:

1. My tea pot holds a little under 2 cups of water. I put in a tablespoon (3 tsps) of rolled leaves in the infuser.
2. I warm up water in a kettle to just before it starts to whistle
3. I pour the water into the tea pot w/infuser. I let it sit for \~20 seconds before pouring out the water to ""wash the leaves"" as I've seen on YouTube.
4. I pour hot water back into the tea pot and let it sit for about 2 minutes before pouring myself a cup. Although the aroma is there, the flavor is mostly watery.

So, questions. First, if I want a stronger flavor do I just add more leaves? Second, after I do the second pour at 2 minutes, am I supposed to remove the infuser? Or will leaving it in produce a stronger creamy taste? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",First time making tea and not understanding the steps

I want to get back into matcha after having spent some time with loose leaf and coffee, so am looking for recommendations for companies and specific matchas that people have liked, and why they like them (e.g. flavor, company history, company ethics, price point, etc).

I like strong vegetal flavors and umami. I also see value as part of my enjoyment, so will personally gravitate towards a high quality-to-price ratio over an outright ""best"" that is super expensive.

I’m currently in a recruitment process on the last round of interviews.

They ask me to prepare myself to give an explanation on how I would teach to an 8-year-old kid to do a perfect cup of tea.

I already gave some thoughts about it but I wanted to ask people's opinion on Reddit!

I naturally think that they want to know how I reason and how I will act as a pedagogue to keep a child's attention, what kind of techniques I’ll use to get to the objective and not really focus much on the actual technical way to do a perfect cup of tea.

What I found was that the salt changed the taste of the tea. The water became heavy bodied, and you could taste the minerals coming from the salt. The fruitiness did not emerge, rather the bitterness was prominent. 

My hypothesis is that that technique is not suitable for light teas, i.e., green, white (not aged), yellow, and green oolongs, and dancong. I still don't know if this works in heavily roasted oolong, red tea, puerh, or heicha.

12913,tea,"So I got this 6 year aged white tea. I put 3g of it in a steeper, and just steeped it for 3 minutes in a cup of boiling water (205F)

I drank most of it in about 15 minutes, and I was on my computer working as I usually am and about 20-30 minutes later I noticed my heart was pounding in my chest and I couldn't sit still. I was pacing and felt anxious.

I decided to take my blood pressure with a good cuff I have at home and it came back as:

168/100

This is INSANELY high for me. I am usually in a perfect (105 - 115) / (70-80). I am young, healthy, non-overweight, exercise often type of person. So this was quite a shock. I laid down and breathed and had lots of water and after about 30-40 minutes I was back to my normal perfect BP.

I have NO idea what that was... I've had panic attacks before, this didn't really feel like that since it seem completely localized to my BP and not a spiraling of thoughts? And I've had aged white tea before as well and never had this crazy reaction. But I think I may have made it stronger than usual this time around.

Is this something that can happen with caffeine or aged tea? Such a short sharp increase of blood pressure that goes away shortly after?

Anyways, thanks!",Sudden jump in blood pressure after drinking aged white tea?

I want to gift something to my daughters teacher and she said she is “way into” London Fog Lattes. I imagine that there are as many ways to prepare that as any other mixed beverage, so I’m thinking maybe accoutrements would be better than tea itself? I live in a pretty tea-friendly area (Portland, OR) so I have some options at least. She prepares her lattes at home to save money, fwiw.

12925,tea,"This is probably a bit of a long shot, but I'm trying to get a few teas to approximate Twinings Prince of Wales, for a friend. Having never tried it myself AND not being well-versed in black teas, I'm basically going off the box label and digging round the interwebs. 

The box suggests the tea origins are Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Yunnan provinces. The taste is described as light, smooth, mild; not as malty as English Breakfast; and a bit of sweetness. I've read that the base of the tea is thought to be Keemun black needles, and other than the above, some places say it might have a dash of gunpowder green. The only Yunnan tea I've tried is golden snail/golden bud. I've had a browse around What-cha, Adagio, and Imperial Teas but am otherwise feeling a bit uninspired. I also had a scroll through Yunnan Sourcing, but other than the province names I don't really know what I'm looking for.

I'm looking for hints on how to host a tea party. I've done basic Googling,  but I'm still unsure about stuff.

Please toss ANY tips to me.  Assume I know nothing. If I hadn't asked on if the teapot could go on the stove, or if it's just for the microwave , I would not have known its not for either. Just because the same shape as a kettle, doesn't mean it's a kettle. 

I'm going to cricut some paper doilies and make an acrylic/wood snack tray. Is catdstock okay? 

Can I make name placards for guests? 

Do I wear an apron?

I had a few questions though because I have also seen Mylar Bags be recommended. 

YS sends their tea in sturdy mylar bags (their samples and loose leaf tea I've gotten at least). ? Their cakes come in a plastic ziplock. Similarly, Mei Leaf uses some sturdy paper ziplock bags for their loose leaf and cakes. Are these good enough to store the tea as I make my way through them? 

Should I get moisture or oxygen absorbers? I live in a desert climate. Dry/hot dry/cool &amp; low humidity. 
My set up was going to be to stick an oxygen pack and moisture absorber in a mason jar along with the tea. I get.

I've been drinking tea in inconsistent amounts for years (3+ cups per day then a ""dry spell"" of no tea for a little while), but recently I have upped my consumption and have decided that I finally want to get a tea pot.

This year I've ordered the [**Bird &amp; Blend Advent Calendar**](https://www.birdandblendtea.com/products/tea-advent-calendar) calendar: I liked it because the blends looked interesting (I had a sneak peek though I'm now trying to forget, so it's more of a surprise each day in December), they also do two teabags each day so I can do it with my kid, and they ship affordably to Australia. The latter was a dealbreaker for many other tea calendars I viewed.

I did read a [couple](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/g13408658/tea-advent-calendars/) of [articles](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/christmas/gift-ideas/g28901220/tea-advent-calendars/) on the best tea calendars for 2021. The [**Fortnum &amp; Mason Advent Calendar**](https://www.fortnumandmason.com/fortnums-tea-filled-wooden-advent-calendar-600g) looks stunning but £145 plus god knows what to ship it internationally (if they even ship here) was a bit beyond my budget.

The [**Pukka Herbs Tea Advent Calendar**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08F8QHLV3) is quite affordable, but contains mainly blends that I've already had plus it doesn't seem like it's much of a ""surprise"" each day.

Others I investigated included [**The English Tea Shop Advent Calendar**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B072MN1ZZW) but the availability and varieties were confusing - I can't work out what colour is ""this year's"" calendar - there are various ones floating around on eBay. I also couldn't find an actual website for the company which might have helped (anyone know it?)

The [Newby Tea Advent Calendar](https://www.newbyteas.com/gb/advent-calendar-2021.html) also looked tempting as I love their Earl Grey, but it's on the expensive side at £85 and I wasn't sure if the varieties were that innovative.

Unfortunately here in europe, unless you are lucky or go to a dedicated tea shop, usually the only green tea you can get is some low quality (often lemon flavoured) bagged tea from china.

So what i usually do, especially when i am on vacation in a hotel, is bringing my own tea-can, tea-filter and food thermometer and just order hot water. 

The thing is that you get a lot of glances because you are that weirdo bringing all that stuff, and especially in a restaurant it feels kind of weird because you are basically bringing your own food which is frowned upon.

13236,tea,"Hello everyone!

This will be a sea of text (sort of review) about my new oolong finding.

My first oolong tea was a cheap eBay Taiwanese ginseng oolong, which was strong and sweet at first but  it quickly became astringent, bitter and sour. Needless to say that I hated oolongs (I still have that one bag of tea nearly intact in hope that my taste will change).  


Thanks to to an amazing person, who recommended me dark and roasted oolongs I got back through the Mi Lan Xiang Dancong - which may be the single most amazing tea for me, but green oolongs were still a no-go.

Fast forward to today with **Cho Shi King of Duck Shit**.

&amp;#x200B;

[Majestic, big, vibrant green leaves](https://preview.redd.it/jrxunox596s71.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=445895f02e566dd6aa26b4455d08ccf0bf756aff)

&amp;#x200B;

[Amazing aroma of jasmine, sour sop, butter, steamed spinach, orchids.](https://preview.redd.it/ezl2e4se96s71.jpg?width=3152&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dfd0b8b0b70fbc8b7a6e613efb01d22cfbde5e0)

This tea made me want to try the green oolongs again.

The dried leaves smell of orchids, jasmine and melted butter. The wet leaves smelled like salted Japanese plums, butter, toasted spinach, artichoke with a hint of lilac. The texture of the tea was medium thick, lubricating and smooth. The tea tasted rich, green apple, steamed greens, jasmine, coconut water. There were hints of wild berries with medium strong minerality and left a sort of tropical fruits with lingering sweet aftertaste. After drinking, the gong dao bei smelled like charred corn, jasmine, butter, boiled peanuts.

The first few infusions had a strong Tie Guan Yin taste, while the latter ones shift towards the classic Ya Shi characteristics.

I know usually people stuff their gaiwan with oolongs, but even with 5g/100ml this was a phenomenal tea to enjoy for a whole morning.

I do not go lightly with tea grades, BUT this one is a massive 10/10 from me.

13312,tea,So I had this tea recently but I forgot what it was. It was orange and color. It had taste of zesty orange peel. Notes of green tea like yingzhen and longjing. The mouth feel was super velvety syrupy and viscous. It was deliciously refreshing. Felt very calm after drinking it.,What was this sweet tea?
13313,tea,"A few years ago, I bought a bag of loose-leaf Mexican Hot Chocolate tea from Tattle Tea.  It had Mombasa pepper in it (apparently more commonly called peri-peri), so it was spicy-hot and it changed my entire outlook on tea.  They had a few other teas like this, one of which had peppermint, peri-peri and rooibos (soooo good).   I even bought some extra Mombasa pepper to make my teas EXTRA spicy.

Fortunately I bought a 2lb bag of the Mexican Hot Chocolate tea, since they've since stopped selling almost all of their non-standard teas, including my favorites, and I haven't found anyone else that makes ""spicy-hot"" tea with chile peppers.

13317,tea,"Good Evening people of Reddit!

I am going to keep this semi-short and sweet so as to not lose your attention. 

I have been saving up capital for years and have finally decided to do something that I’ve wanted to do for, well, years. I am going to start a tea e-commerce company. A percentage (not yet determined) will be going towards either environmental  conservancy and/or veteran support charities. I am a veteran/service member, (currently serving in the reserve) so I take pride in the support of our veterans who do not receive enough support. Before I enlisted I worked as a barista and I ultimately came down with a detrimental case of tea addiction and have been seeking out the best teas ever since.

My first focus is matcha that I intend to be sourcing from the Uji Region of Japan. In preparation for this, I have been learning Japanese for a few years and will be traveling there for quality assurance before sealing any deals. Because ceremonial grade is much higher in price, I am coming into this game prepared to lose thousands/tens-of-thousands of dollars in profit to keep prices low if it means the success of my company and the delectation of my customers. 

I will, of course, be breaking into more markets than that of just Matcha. More on this in later posts. 

What I want to hear from you, Reddit, is what do YOU want to see come from a new company. I know there isn’t much innovation room in the tea world; however, in order to guarantee the success of a company which I am sacrificing so much for, I have come to the source, the people, and want to hear from you in order to successfully make a product that appeals to the consumers rather than some big-name CEO wallet. I have 3 weeks left at my current civilian job, after that it is full steam ahead on this project. 

I have left out some major details in this post and will be posting more in the future. Feel free to be critical. Do please keep the criticism constructive.

Normally when brewing a pot of tea for myself I use one of those metal infuser things that hang in the opening at the top of the teapot, and take it out when it's finished steeping, which of course is ideal because that way cups after the first cup are not way stronger.

When I put the leaves directly into the teapot, after pouring and drinking the first cup from the teapot, consequent cups are of course too strong because they then have been steeping for more like 5 or 6 minutes.

How can I work around this? I was considering pouring the whole teapot worth of tea into a jug after it's steeped and then pour my cups from that jug, but I feel like it would cool down a lot faster in a jug.

13352,tea,"High mountain of Kerala- Grown at elevations between 4,760 ft &amp; 8,842 ft above sea-level, these are finer, more fragrant &amp; refined teas with complex flavours. The slow growth process that occurs from the unique climatic &amp; geographic conditions seen at higher altitudes, allow essential oils &amp; character to build in the leaves, making them healthier &amp; tastier teas.  


Most of the bitterness in tea come from polyphenols that develop as natural pest control. With fewer pests at higher elevations, the plants produce fewer bitter compounds &amp; are sweeter.  


The cold temperature and rockier soil at higher altitudes decrease crop yields. The downhill flow of rainwater, rocky soil &amp; natural drainage reduces the water available for plants. Hence, organic practices are preferred for tea cultivation as fast-growing fertilized plants do not develop a strong, deep root system to survive cold winters.  


This allows flavour compounds to get concentrated in the plants. These creamy teas last through many infusions &amp; few leaves suffice to brew a strong tea.

The older I got I understood that people drank tea hot or cold and when you were sick people would tell you to drink it. All it ever was to me was funny tasting water.

Now I'm a full out forager with a couple shelves full of dried plants and yern for a 3k tetsubin.

I've learned alot in this time, but one thing I can not figure out is what to call the things I drink.

When the world (defiantly in the US) hears ""Tea"" I would bet most think of black iced tea or green tea in some form. In other words; the word tea means hot or cold water infusion of the plant  Camellia sinensis 

Why is this? and what should I call a hot or cold water infusion of chamomile, lavender, or raspberry leaf.

If I say I'm drinking a lavender tea, doesn't that actually mean I'm drinking a lavender (Lavandula) Tea  (Camellia sinensis)  drink not just a lavender drink

I am by no means an expert or tea guru; these ramblings are unadulterated thoughts of an entirely subjective experience.

**Brief Profile**: YS's 2021 Meeting Place is a blend of 2015-2016 Menghai, Simao, and Lincang raw pu-erh teas. This tea blend was aged as loose-leaf maocha in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China. Price clocks in at £0.13/g ($0.18/g) per 357g cake. 

[Brewing with an Yixing teapot that was gifted to me by a family friend. A fairness pitcher was used during the session but is out of sight here :'\)](https://preview.redd.it/rdfigm5rzoq71.jpg?width=3556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae2436d1a165e83eff6119f8488b01870c88e9ab)

**First Impressions**: an aesthetically pleasing mix of light and dark and almost wooden dry leaves. Typically, I find dry leaf aroma to be fleeting and often unrepresentative but Meeting Place has a distinct note that's hard to place. It reminds me almost of penny liquorice sweets that I used to buy as a child in the UK many years ago. Certainly, there is a dark sweetness that's both pleasant and hard to ignore.

[Meeting Place, broken-up. ](https://preview.redd.it/uggvotsw0pq71.jpg?width=3454&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ffd9bf1197f5a41523c061423b8201518023f7)

**The Session**: after a 20-second rinse and a subsequent 10-minute pause to allow the leaves to open up a bit, I dived head-first into the session. The dry liquorice aroma evolved into something between roasted yams and Twizzlers with the addition of a remote bonfire/charcoal note too. The taste was immediately sweet and rich with the puckering intensity of dried dates or apricots. Meeting Place's thick and structured texture complemented the sweetness by coating the mouth like lacquer to a nail. 

[A \(perhaps slightly too full\) teacup. Cute sleepy baby design is optional but highly recommended.](https://preview.redd.it/o7xoqyab2pq71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ce67cc62433b093094be6ef735807b633542bea)

In colour, body, and *hui gan* (returning sweetness) I am reminded of creamed honey. The tail notes of the tea are ones of astringent, dry candies and stoned fruits that I have noticed before in other Lincang teas. But most of these notes are by no means distinct. Meeting Place is a tea to enjoy, not to analyse and dissect. 

The name ""Meeting Place"" is an apt choice. The name makes me imagine a gathering of friends around a late-night bonfire. The roasting of marshmallows carries the very slight char aroma and the strong sugary sweetness I noted in the tea, particularly after a few more infusions. After nearly a dozen infusions, the liquor remained viscous, clear-bodied, and golden (albeit naturally lighter than before).

The mental image of these friends telling jokes and familiar stories of bygone days around the fire encapsulates the *cha qi* \- the essence and spirit of the tea - perfectly. By the fifth or sixth infusion, a warm sense of comfort and light-headedness took over my body with accompanying, though not execrable, perspiration. The smooth mouth-feel and surprising lack of bitterness strengthened this feeling. Perhaps it was the use of a clay teapot that took off the sharp edge that most young or semi-aged shengs carry, or maybe it was the ageing as mao cha that accelerated its maturity beyond its years. Either way, what I was left with was a somewhat paradoxical 'lubricating astringency' that left me wanting more and more.

**End Notes**: an easy-going, honeyed tea that brought me a lot of warmth amid today's heavy rain and cold winds. The fruity and vaguely floral notes are shy but a joy to feel in both taste and spirit. It's certainly a raw pu-erh that's ready to enjoy now and at a great price point. However, those searching for a raw pu-erh with ""oomph"", ""kick"", or ""pizzazz"" may be left disappointed. Meeting Place lacks bitterness which is desirable for some and undesirable for others. C'est la vie. Pick up a sample and try it for yourself!

The ""builder's tea,"" the strong black tea often preferred by the working class, contrasts sharply with the subtle notes of the posh white-collar Earl Grey. I'm oversimplifying a bit, sure, but the point is that I'm a working class hero despite having worked from home for the past year and a half and I've spent my time working on the perfect cup of builder's tea right here in the states. I'd like to share it with you, even though I'm sure that these opinions may be even more divisive than claiming Peter Capaldi as my favorite Doctor. 

Let's start with the least controversial-seeming ingredient in the tea: the water. A lot of people, even me in my early tea days, wouldn't give this ingredient a second thought and simply fill the kettle at the sink, but I've read literal pages of information about this step of tea-making and have realized these people are making a grave mistake. You've heard the statistic that we spend a third of our lives in bed, making a bed one of our most important purchases? Well check this one out: a cup of tea is 99% water. If you're not at least filtering that water, you're doing yourself a disservice. Don't think it will make a difference? Try it and find out. 

A quick note on American tea kettles: they're outdated. A stovetop kettle will make a cup of tea fine, but it's the tea equivalent of using a rotary phone instead of a mobile. Electric kettles are fast, versatile, often beautiful, and most importantly cheap. The extra three minutes you're waiting for that tea to boil is eating your life away, and that's not even getting into temperature settings for different types of tea. Catch up with the world and get an electric kettle. 

Speaking of American products that aren't conducive to proper tea-making, a coffee mug is not a teacup, and bigger isn't always better. You can use a coffee mug for your tea, I'm certainly not above doing so myself, but you have to bear in mind that the amount of water that a nice strong cup of tea requires is going to look very paltry and disappointing in that giant mug. I'm not advocating for teacups and saucers in every household, this isn't Alice In Wonderland, I just think it's an easy pitfall for Americans to believe that more of something is always better, and with boiling water and tea I can assure you it isn't. 

Are you ready for the next most controversial ingredient? Bet you didn't think it would take this long to get to it. It's milk. It's absolutely milk. You might think that enjoying your coffee or tea black is some sort of showcase of fortitude, but it's more like preferring your steak boiled. It's incorrect. Breakfast tea is first and foremost an excuse for grown adults to drink milk, and you should not, nay, can not deny yourself the experience. 

Here come the replies. I can see them now. ""I haven't had milk in years!"" ""What about lactose-intolerant people?"" I get it. I don't drink milk either, but in case you haven't noticed, there's a ton of non-dairy milk alternatives out there, and a few of them even taste good. My personal go-to is the Planet Oat Extra Creamy oat milk, but I'm not going to die on the hill of calling it the best option. I used real whole milk in the UK because it was delicious and worth all of the associated stomach trouble, but with the annoying pasteurization standards in the US I'd say use whatever substitute you like. Almost any substitute, anyway. For gods sake don't throw powdered creamer in there, you monster. 

And so we reach the politics and religion of tea-making: what tea am I using? Bag or loose leaf? Assam, Ceylong, Darjeeling, perhaps a blend? A million enraged responses rest on my answers here, and I'm excited to disappoint. After a lot of consideration and sampling from across the black tea market, I use Tazo Awake English Breakfast tea in bags. 

Before you kill me, please give me a chance to explain. I'm not suggesting that the tea brand served at Subway restaurants is the best choice for everyone. Choice in tea blend is incredibly personal and I don't condone judging anyone's taste or pushing them toward a particular brand. That said, I do think people who boil loose leaf black teas in strainers might be psychopaths. I tried it for a good while with several recommended brands, and it feels not unlike rolling your own cigarettes. It's a raw unfiltered punk rock experience and it's not at all for the faint of heart, which leaves me out. 

As far as finding the right tea for you goes, I'd say try everything, but I've found in my personal experience that tea leaves lose something when they travel overseas. British tea is better in the UK. American tea is better in the states. Could this be entirely placebo effect? Totally, but I think science will back me up on it some day. Most importantly, the tea for you should be tasty, strong enough to punch some flavor through a generous amount of milk, and able to withstand a scalding dose of water. 

Which finally brings me to my last point: preparation. I don't really measure this stuff out, but I think a standard tea bag will take 150-250 ml of hot boiling-ass water, poured on as quickly as possible after it reaches the boiling point. You want to scald those leaves. Don't worry, they like it. They were made for it. If you find your black breakfast tea tastes too strong or burnt after pouring scalding water on it, you're drinking the wrong breakfast tea. Try another one. 

Steep time varies from tea to tea, but in general I've found that pulling the tea bag after about 3 minutes gets me the flavor profile I'm looking for. Your experience may vary. Either way, get that tea bag out of there and dump that milk on. I'm not even going to guess how much, but I'm going to say try going more generous with it than you think you should. Milk is great; don't trust any hipsters trying to tell you otherwise. Unless you've poured enough to make your tea go cold, one of the UK's most tragic circumstances, you're probably going to enjoy your cup. 

And that's my take on the perfect cup of breakfast tea. I look forward to being eviscerated for it, or at the very least seeing some ""TL;DR"" responses.",An American's Guide To A Cuppa Breakfast Tea

I'm still accustoming myself to the world of tea and I've been expanding my palate over the past few months. I've ordered some tea samplers from What-Cha as well as a few teas from Yunnan Sourcing. I have little tolerance for snobbery and enjoy cheap flavored tea meant to be paired with sugar/honey/milk for different values and reasons than I appreciate whole leaf Eastern greens and oolongs from reputable vendors (In the course of drafting this post, I've had both Earl Grey with a splash of vanilla and Duck Shit Aroma Oolong). 

I drink tea most often while at work-from-home, so I find tea suitable for infuser/teapot brewing or ""grandpa""-friendly teas/stuff like Longjing that can be re-steeped from within the drinking vessel to be best suited for me, but I do occasionally drink gongfu when I have time to myself in the evenings.

As I've mentioned before, I'm still new to drinking more classical varieties of tea and I don't want to miss out. I have plenty of tea right now, but as I drink more, I'd like some suggestions, from all quality levels, on what to try next!

- Bigelow Constant Comment
- Bigelow English Teatime
- Twinings Irish Breakfast

Higher Quality Loose-Leaf Flavored Teas:

- JusTea Kenyan Earl Grey

Unflavored Black Teas:
- Mi Xiang
- Not much experience here tbh

Greens:
- Sencha of the Autumn Moon
- Dragon Well (a cheaper variety from YS; I wasn't a fan at first but it's grown on me)

Oolongs:
- Duck Shit (LOVE LOVE LOVE this one)
- Jin Xuan
- Jade
- Red Tiger
- Been on a huge oolong kick. Drinking oolongs grandpa style has been my go-to lately

I've never tried White Tea (though I'd love to!) and I'm a little afraid to try Pu-erh.

Next 9% VAT, and 3.2% duty taxes. Now... this can't be done in the customs office, only by third party agencies approved by the national customs, and they charged me $35 per type of imported goods (thanks that no one knows how many teas are there so everything in my list was black and green tea  - $70).

Was it worth it? I don't know anymore. As a lesson It sure as hell was worth it. Next time I'll buy a packet with value less than $150 and with weight less than 2kg-s twice, and I'll pay the courier twice, that way the packet will arrive at my door, and no such hassle.

I was thinking of starting a service where people can get any tea in sample sizes only, for cheap, sort of like a tea sample warehouse, because I feel like getting sample sizes of teas is a little difficult and sometimes wasteful. In my opinion, you buy a tea and, especially if it's high quality tea, you spend money on it, but then what happens if you don't like it? You let it sit on your shelf and it gets stale, so it's wasteful for both money and tea. Also from what I've seen, some shops offer samples but either only as an addition in buying a regular size bag, or cheap samples but shipping is still very expensive for just a sample. 

Bottom line question is, would you find such a service useful and actually buy from an online shop that cheaply provides samples of many different teas for you to try out, before getting a larger bag?

jasmine pearls that is, my favorite green.(so far)

Im mainly a black and oolong blends head, and the most greens I occasionally drink are bottled Japanese green tea I get from stores, Itoen, Kirin bottles to name a few. 

They are good, especially on a hot summer day, refreshing and quenching my thirst, and of good quality for bottled teas, beating some wacky tea bags of green for sure, but i don't really go out of my way to stock up those teas and am not crazy about those either. After reading some insights on this sub about greens from different countries, I realized the reason I don't care for greens might be that Im not a huge fan of this vegetal/grassy taste profile of this kind of green tea.

Then here comes my order of Jasmine Dragon Pearls. I think im falling love with my jasmine pearls. I feel like Im drinking jasmine buds, like the aroma of fresh, delicate jasmine flowers dissolved in the tea, and this extremely clean, slightly sweet aftertaste, lingering aroma after sips is divine. Watching these dragon pearls unfold in my mug is just satisfying, and these little pearls are so cute.

The only downside tho, is the tea comes in sachets which I don't get it, there's no broken leaves/scraps in there to be sealed in those sachets from getting into your mouthful sips and the extra point of having rolled leaves is to watch them slowly unfold in hot water? Each time I just tear through the sachet, discard it and brew these loose pearls lol.

13813,tea,"I'm writing this post, because today I felt like I would explode, so beware the long text without meaning.

I know we are living some in some hard conditions now. I also know that the distance between me and the tea vendors is not exactly negligible. This is why I usually save some interesting teas that I really want to try and I only order once or twice a year, to minimize shipping costs (relative to the product) and other hassle. 

Well today I found out how little one person is in the schemes of capitalism and bureaucratic formations. I have ordered a ""small"" package from YS which may or may not had a value of $230. First slap was the lack of courier option, only air mail, which translates to Romanian post and that means waiting for more than a month (the price was nearly the same as using DHL from the last time). I was OK with this.   
I was even OK with the fact that I must pay VAT (9%) and some other duties (3% since the value is more than $150). 

The packet arrived at the customs office. I've received a message that I can get the packet, but I have to bring a transaction extract, which is expected. There they say that I can't have the package, because I have to write some import declaration, which can only be done at another facility which is twice as far as the customs office from me. Of course, everything is done in person, because we don't live in a year with pandemic, or we do not have PC-s and internet. After I go there sign what needs to be signed, pay what needs to be payed, I have to go back to the customs to prove it, and to get the package.Oh, did I mention that these nice fellas only work 3 days in a week, once 7 hours and twice 6 hours? And that after 3 work days they charge me extra for some sort of upkeep?

How the hell does a person who has a full-time job comply with the bullshits of a country?

Did I really make a mistake of having tea as a hobby? Or being born in a peasant-ass country as mine?

Are customs services in other countries the same?

I ordered this tea from YS after it was recommended when I reached out for suggestions. It is amazing! I don’t really like drinking it gong fu simply because I love the round robustness I get from western, I think this is generally how I feel about black teas anyway( let me know if you have a black tea that you feel gong fu does it true justice)

So as for flavor I have had it hot and cold and both have a great personality. 

Hot- first you get a nice light black tea flavor then a flash of cocoa (like good dark chocolate) that then fades to a nice mellow sweetness.

Cold- first off you get a nice robust mix of tea and tannins followed by the light sweetness from like the hot and then notes of raw cocoa. After you swallow the notes of cocoa take over and give you a full mouth flavor that reminds me of chewing cocoa nibs.

Overall this tea is an excellent buy and my 50g order was not nearly enough. With the rate me and my dad are drinking it I could see a 500g-1Kg order in the near future. Let me know what you guys think or any tips/comments you have :)",Black and gold Bi Lou Chun

So far I've only tasted two teas:

* the Issin-en kuki hojucha, which blew me away with the flavour. In the past I had some low grade houjicha, which tasted roasted, and bitter, but nothing more. This one was toasty, with strong chocolate, mineral taste, no bitterness what so ever. The smell reminded me the camping nights at seashore. The tea was mild, smooth yet a flavor bomb, and sweet after taste. If this is what I can expect from a stem tea, I have high hopes for the other ones.
* the Gyokuro Karigane. I have no experience with gyokuro teas. So far I only tasted some fukamushi sencha. This one was a flavor bomb too. The smell from the kyusu was of strong steamed asparagus and butter roasted spinach. The tea was full of umami, freshly cut grass with some slight saltiness. In the consequent brews the floral notes become dominant and there was a consistent sweet aftertaste.

I’m trying to buy a new electric kettle (in the UK) and I have a very sensitive palate and I’m struggling to find one that doesn’t taste of plastic, even after trying all the taste tricks; boiling and reboiling, using bicarb, descaler, lemon juice and salt water etc. 
I don’t know if it’s a BPA issue, some companies state that they don’t use BPA plastics anywhere they would ‘come into contact’ with food/drink, but I’m not sure if that includes lids, and if so, I have no idea what it is I can taste. I would have thought a kettle containing no BPA plastics would lose that plastic taste after it’d been boiled 40-50 times. 

My last successful kettle was an all stainless steel Russell Hobbs (Model 23925) but they don’t make it any more, and it lacks a little anyway. I’ve tried two other Russell Hobbs kettles this week, the purity kettle with brita filter (which is plastic but I thought I’d give it a chance, it’s not too bad but I’m not a fan overall) and their stainless steel quiet boil kettle (which is lovely as a kettle except the taste which is awful and I just can’t resolve). 

I’m just wondering what kettles or kettle brands you’ve been successful with in the UK, for those with sensitive palates. I don’t mind general brand recommendations but there’s not much point recommending a model that’s been discontinued completely. Any recommendations I’ve been able to find have either been outdated or not available in the UK, or have been based on the description rather than experience.

I’ve been drinking Tea in India all my life, but what’s most common here is  tea dust which most tea experts don’t consider worthwhile. 

I’ve always had at least 2 cups a day with fresh lemongrass added - I grow my own. My daily cuppa is water, fresh lemongrass and/or ginger, Tata gold tea, drop of milk, 1.5 sugar.

Last year just before covid I stayed a week in Darjeeling and visited local tea gardens and shops. Most tea stores asked us what type of tea we drank daily and were either dismissive or in a couple of instances, downright rude.. saying what we mainlanders drank wasn’t tea, and some other bad terms.. 

I’ve since been very embarrassed of my tea love.. I bought a small packet of white tea since they kept saying if I really claim to like tea that is what I shud drink and I’ve been lit. rationing it coz it’s so expensive.. but it made me scared of joining here..

I just discovered this Subreddit and thought I would say hello 😊

Being from Ireland I was a tea drinker when I was younger. In Ireland there are two main brands - Lyons and Barrys. There is always a fierce debate about which is the more superior brand. It's Lyons for me. But when I was younger I always had milk in my tea, sometimes I put sugar in it sometimes I didn't.

Then I became a coffee drinker. I loved my Lattes, cappuccinos etc. Every so often I would give it up and go back to Tea but that would only last a couple of weeks. 

About 3 months ago after a period of ill health I gave up the Lattes and Cappuccinos and went back on the tea. And not the tea with milk. And I have to say I'm loving it. I adore green tea. Have tried Dandelion and Nettle which tastes like dirt but are enjoyable 😁. I've bought loose herbs to make my own tea. I recently tried Rooibos which I like and my next step is trying Pur Eh tea. I love the Pukka brand of teas and also Hearth and Heather. I discovered I prefer the earthy flavours rather than the fruity flavours. I've ran out of space for all my teas 😂

I recently bought a gorgeous silver plated teapot by Yeoman, does anyone know what kind of base metal Yeoman used?

Near the little holes on the inside there seems to be a tiny about of silvery looking metal missing and it looks a bit like copper - is it cooper or rust, and would either of these things be of concern? Is it possible to restore it somehow? It really is a beauty, I don't want to use it as a vase...! I don't know its exact age, my guess is ca. 40s or 50s.

14038,tea,"I recently got a pretty decent sized order from YS and I’m going to right reviews on here as I try the teas,to help myself reflect and better understand tea and to provide an interesting read for anyone who likes a more in-depth read on a tea.


I have never had silver needle before or really any white tea but I was super excited for this one and ordered 100g- great decision

Ratios: 120ml useable space in my gaiwan- 5 grams of tea (will use 6 next time)- freshly boiled water

Taste and fragrance: after the wash it put off a wonderful smell of flowers and sweetness, I’d love a candle that smells like this wonderful tea. The first few steeps are light without to much body and a nice sweet undertone, very reminiscent of flower water? Once you get to the 3rd or 4th steep this tea starts to ramp up, the buds are open and ready. You get a very strong flowery nectar flavor for about two steeps that then fades to the background and allows the tea flavor to come forward. I kept the steeps under a minute at this point and it never grew astringent, just a very powerful tea flavor and then a wave of flower like sweetness.It’s mouth feel was thick but a little dry and left the after taste that I can best describe as a spring field. Later in- around 7 or 8 steeps- the sweetness slowly disappears and you get a nice full bodied white tea.

I would recommend this tea and will mostly likely serve to friends. It could be a very easy daily drink as it’s not to potent in any direction but it still carries its weight.

I heard tea bags are generally frowned upon in the tea community (for years I've drank Whole Foods green tea bags in those big 70-packs, I'm actually drinking some as I'm typing this out), and I've heard lukewarm/mixed reception on gunpowder tea (which seems to be a bit better quality than bagged tea, and is priced very low).

I know tea is highly subjective, so I'll try to make it as easy as possible for you guys to make a suggestion.


I like to drink *only unsweetened* tea if it's hot, I don't like to add additional flavors or sweeteners. I boil tea the ""rough"" way (I basically just bring water in a small stovetop pot to almost-boiling, around 180-190°F, and seep the tea for 5 minutes exactly), I don't have any fancy expensive tea kettle or anything. 

I generally drink tea *by itself*. I don't drink it while I'm eating food.

I only drink 1 can or so a night but would like to replace it with something a bit healthier if possible and the suggestion I heard was tea.

1. Based on everyone's alignment charts, the tea that I enjoy(teavana type teas with lots of fruits or berries for flavor) is neutral or evil so I wanted to ask if there was a better option. Ideally I would want to stick to some very fruity teas with sugar or honey added based on my flavor preferences but I don't know if I am missing anything. (sorry if this is blasphemous but even with wines and mead and stuff I am not a fan of subtle flavor profiles and prefer to be blasted by fruits and berries)

2. Where would I buy teas like this? I saw the choice vendors list but did not find anything that was similar.

3. How do you know how many times you can steep tea and how many seconds it should take each time?

4. A tin seems pretty straight forward but something to heat the water up to the correct temperature and the strainers I have seen all have pretty bad reviews on amazon. Is there something you would recommend?

Ok so after making my own tea pets I wanted to create a guide on how to DIY your own. The process is relatively inexpensive, somewhat messy, but super rewarding. With a bit of artistic talent and some gusto you can turn a handful of dry dirt into a beautiful little tea companion. This is in no way a perfect guide but it should have the basic info 

Tools
For clay gathering/sculpting: 
Metal mesh strainer 
2 buckets 
Some sort of cloth (I used an old bedsheet)
A baking pan or sheet 
Popsicle sticks or any other sculpting tools 

For firing: 
Metal pot with a lid 
Metal tongs (make sure they’re nice and long)
Scrap wood and any flammable materials 
Bricks, cinder blocks, or just flat stones 


Step 1: gathering the clay 

Yea you could probably just buy clay from your local craft store. But after the whole hobby lobby smuggling scheme I just decided to do it myself and not give money to those crazy fucks. 

1. Gather some dirt. Try to walk around and find a spot where the dirt is pale and cracked looking. Try looking around construction sites or places where the topsoil has been removed. Make sure to take out any plants or large debris 

2. Put the dry dirt in a bucket with water and mix it with your hands. Make sure to add roughly double the water as there is dirt. The trick here is that clay will remain suspended in water far longer than sand or gravel. Let the dirt soup sit for a bit and you’ll see the sand settle to the bottom 

3. Put the strainer on top of a bucket and carefully pour the dirt soup through it to strain out the gravel. If the strainer is fine enough the sand will also be strained through. 

4. The water should now be soley clay particles, if some sand remains try to filter it a few more times. 

5. Get a peice of fine fabric (I used a part of an old bedsheet) and put it over the opening of the empty second bucket. Pour the clay slurry into the cloth. It will take a long time to filter, so just let it sit for sound 2-3 hours. Once most of the water is gone simply wrap the rest of the cloth around the clay and hang it from a place off the ground so it can dry further. When the clay is no longer slimy it’s ready to use

Step 2: the fire

1. Sculpt the tea pets and let them fully dry for a day or more. The color should lighten. 
Put the tea pets in the oven and slowly raise the temperature. While they’re baking you can go outside and set up the fire. If you have a fire pit you can just use that, but since I don’t I just put an old metal pot on top of two bricks and started the fire inside that. 

2. If you have charcoal briquettes then go ahead and use those. If not, try to gather firewood or dry sticks. 

3. Once the fire gets going you can take the tea pets out of the oven and put them directly into the fire. The gradual heating up ensures they are fully dry before they are fired 

4. Keep adding fuel to the fire for as long as you desire. 

5. After 2 hours or so you can let the fire burn out. Wait at least 8 hours (or overnight) so the tea pets are fully cooled down and you don’t accidentally burn yourself 

6. Brush off the ashes and volia! Your teapets are done!

I couldn't help noticing on this subs recommended tea merchant list the company Yunan Sourcing, which looks like a particularly cheap offering of good quality authentic tea.
Some of the prices, however look a little too good to be true? When buying teas, I'm looking for good quality (largely spring harvested) from the correct province and area at high altitude (if from China) and good sourcing info if from elsewhere.

As the title says I'm looking for some recommendation on which brands to buy to get chinese tea.

We also have Palais des Thés and Kusmi Tea in France which I never really tried because they were a bit too hyped up for my taste.

It'd be very nice if you have any experience or recommendations to share on brands I should look into for chinese tea.

14317,tea,"I've tried so many times to make tea at home (granted I just use pre-packaged tea bags), and every time it just tastes like hot water with maybe the tiniest bit of flavor that I can't even enjoy.

I don't like bitter stuff. Never had. I can't even drink coffee. I can drink cool water, flavored water, milk, juice, soda, hot chocolate, etc with no problem. But I just can't get into tea.

I want to, though. Everyone who likes tea seems to be so passionate about it. All the stuff about health benefits and that air of sophistication just makes me so envious of people who can develop that taste for tea.

But I guess I can't handle anything too bitter or subtle. I need a satisfying amount of sweetness and/or fruitiness to really like a drink.

Maybe I just suck at making tea, though. I've only ever had it when I've tried to make it myself. Like I said, it always just tastes like hot water. Sure, the water turns brown and I can smell the stuff okay, but when I take a sip it's just...echhh...

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Maybe I need to find a flavor that's more suiting to my needs? Maybe I need to actually add sweeteners even though that feels like it's ""cheating?"" Maybe I need to use loose leaf tea?

**TL;DR:** Tea isn't flavorful enough for me (at least when I make it) but I wanna like it.

14341,tea,"I've been using electric kettles for 15 years and I feel like I have never had one that combines all the features that one ought to have. Setting aside the cheap ones that just boil off a switch -- I would love a kettle that:

-- showed a ""live"" readout of what the temperature is this moment
-- had easily selectable presets for the various tea temperatures
-- has a decently large top opening for filling and cleaning
-- doesn't leak, which should go without saying but isn't a given

I have had a few that do two (or maybe even three!) of these, but not all four. The Aroma kettle I have at work has a live temp readout (and a cute rainbow LED as the water gets hotter) but the preset temps are annoying to get to (as you have to click through the ""hold at this temp"" setting). I've gone through two Cuisinart kettles at home: the first had easy-to-use presets but no temp readout, and started leaking after two years. The replacement Cuisinart I bought had a temp readout but went to the annoying ""click through multiple buttons to get to the presets"" feature, and also doesn't *actually* come to the temp I selected most of the time (stopping heating at 185 when it's supposed to get to 200, and even sitting and waiting it *might* get to 195). 

Are these first world problems? Yes. But it's weird that this relatively simple machine is hard for companies to get right.

I've been trying to do research and learn about the flavor profiles but nothing I've found is very specific.

I don't like Smoky tasting teas (although I've managed to rinse a tea to get that subtle flavor out) and I prefer complex teas with more punchy flavors that really burst in your mouth and linger a while, and I tend to not like more delicate teas. I have a few good Taiwanese Oolongs already (Four Seasons Spring, Ruby Oolong, an Iron Goddess of Mercy - medium Oolong,) and I also have Gui Fei Oolong, Big Red Robe and two Bao Zhongs. I love the intensity of the floral notes in the Four Seasons Spring I have, and have no complaints at all for the tea I already own. I liked the Bao Zhong, but I prefer the floral intensity of the FSS much more.

I'm SO interested in trying some new Oolongs, but I have no idea where to start. I've been trying to learn about the other types, but I'm still a bit confused since I have a TieGuanYin that's a medium Oolong and all the ones I see listed are light Oolongs. I also don't like bitter teas, and I think astrigency is considered the same thing as bitter? So not sure why people mention both in their posts. ANY help and insight into this would greatly help me.

Since Indian Assamica plants aren't identical to Yunnan Assamica it was quite different, but interesting for also being partly the same.  Bitterness was present but warmer dried fruit flavors stood out.  It probably was a good bit more oxidized than typical sheng, accounting for some of the dark leaf appearance, warmer flavor tones, and dark liquid color, but if it really was in between black tea level and normal sheng I wouldn't have expected it to be so bitter.

I have an incredible fondness for milky oolong I used to drink in a different country with a chinese friend, but ever since I came back to Slovakia, I have found local ordered oolongs upset my stomach to an incredible degree a few minutes after consumption, up to ""I need to bring a bucket in case"" levels. It literally floors me sometimes. 

There was some time where I drank no oolongs, so this might be a change with age, as I have also found myself more intolerant towards milk. I know for a fact this is not a caffeine reaction, as I drink plenty of coffee and mate and have no side effects. 

I have also ordered what was advertised as expensive authentic milky oolong and other oolongs specifically from a well recommended local site due to recommendations to get as authentic tea as possible, but no dice. I have tried drinking on a full stomach, no change. I have this reaction with any oolong specifically. I have not tried many green teas as most in shops are too bitter for my tastes, but no reaction to black tea of any kind. 

I was wondering if anyone with a similar experience with oolongs has founds a good one anywhere where I can order? I am EU but I am not fussed to order anywhere.",Can you recommend me an ( milky) oolong that won't upset my stomach?

1. Using cheap tea bags, I let the bags steep in hot water and place it in the fridge to start cooling the tea down so that I dont need to use ice for the boba tea. The tea comes out pretty strong, light aroma, and a little bit bitter but the bitter flavor is dulled down when I add in almond mik and homemade brown sugar syrup.
2. I heat up around 10oz of water to 175 F (verified by thermometer), and using a red clay teapot, I let about 5 grams of high quality jasmine pearls steep for 3 minutes. I fill up half a glass with tea and I fill in the rest with 2% milk. The jasmine flavor is almost nonexistent since the milk is a lot stronger
3. I heat up around 10oz of water to 175 F (verified by thermometer), and using HALF of the water and a red clay teapot, I let about 5 grams of high quality jasmine pearls steep for 3 minutes. I pour the first batch of tea into a cup and using the rest of my water (heated again to 175F),  I steep the same leaves for 4 minutes. The first batch of tea doesn't have a bitter taste, but the second one does. The flavor is a lot more present in the milk tea with almond milk, but it has a hint of bitterness.

I have been shopping at Spice &amp; Tea Exchange for quite some time now, honestly ever since I began truly enjoying tea 5-6 years ago. I was first introduced the this store in Disney World, and as a big time Disney fan, I find myself down there quite often and typically make my bulk purchases while there and travel home with them. 

This time, I ran out a bit sooner than expected, and did not want to wait until my next trip to restock. I saw that they had free shipping over $45 on their site, so decided to place an order there. I ordered three different teas - 4oz of Iron Goddess of Mercy, 1oz Milk Oolong, and 1oz Organic Yerba Mate. Upon arrival, I was happy to see they were all packaged separately, and packaged very nice at that. But when pulling each out, I immediately noticed a potent smell of spices on each bag. I opened up the bags to smell, and found that the tea itself held that smell as well. I transferred each bag to a sealed glass jar as I typically do in hopes that removing them from the bag would help. Unfortunately, the smell of spice still lingers, albeit a bit lesser than when in the bag. I figured I would try to brew a cup in hopes that it didn't carry over to the palate, but that was not the case. All of the tea has a very prominent spice flavor now, and it is making the tea very difficult to enjoy. 

I've already reached out to Spice &amp; Tea Exchange, and I am assuming they will make things right. But nonetheless, I do not want this tea to go to waste. Has anyone experienced something like this? Is there any way to save the tea? Thanks in advance for any input!",Spice &amp; Tea Exchange

14554,tea,"I've recently started drinking Good Earth's Sweet &amp; Spicy caffeine-free tea and found it to be incredibly sweet to the point of being suspicious. While some of their other blends contain stevia, this one does not list it. It does, however, list ""natural flavors"". Given how loose this definition can be in practice, I'd really like to know exactly what I'm drinking.

I'm not the first person to be skeptical, and someone wrote [a blog post about this particular tea in the Huffington Post](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/natural-herbal-tea_b_836251) questioning what natural flavors they use a few years ago. A lot of reviews on Amazon speculate that it is stevia, but I'm pretty sure it's not since I know the taste of stevia and it is listed when included in their other blends. I'd prefer to avoid any sweeteners as well as any other unnecessary additives, natural or otherwise. 

I've emailed them and they won't disclose the precise ingredients but claim that the only flavors used are extracted from cinnamon and orange oil:

&gt;Natural flavors are generally a mixture of flavoring ingredients that are blended together to give the desired flavor profile. The precise composition of a natural flavor(s) are proprietary to the flavor house.

&gt;The flavoring constituents are derived from a spice, fruit, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or other natural source. The flavoring constituents are extracted and purified from the natural source and blended together to produce the natural flavor for a given product. So a natural flavor with a lemon citrus profile may contain natural constituents derived from lemon, but also from e.g. orange, lime, lemongrass etc. 

&gt;In our Sweet &amp; Spicy tea, the “natural flavor” consists of 100% natural extracts from cinnamon cassia, from Indonesia/Vietnam/China, and oil extracted from oranges in USA. The specific combination of these two ingredients, along with the mix of botanicals, account for the sweetness you taste in the tea.

I'm still not entirely convinced. If you've tried it, you know what I'm talking about. Nothing else I've tried with orange or cinnamon flavors has a level of sweetness anywhere close to this tea. I like it, but I would feel a lot better if I knew what was in it.","What do you think of ""natural flavors"" in tea?"

Tea is something I don't rush. I take my time to make it and enjoy it! For sitting around on lazy mornings, something nice to start the day. To me I have never found even black teas to wake me up so thats why I drink coffee in the morning. Or I have herbal tea like camomile at night to help me sleep.

Typically for tea and coffee I drink it without anything added or at least I'm trying to. For coffee I still add stuff to make it not so bitter and green tea I typically add just honey. (Have not found a green tea that I like to drink plain... yet)

14771,tea,"After playing with the first 6 of the 10 YS black teas I've bought based on the love here, I'm pretty disappointed. For half of the teas so far I couldn't manage to get any decent or even halfway interesting brew at all, they're just bland, boring and/or pretty tasteless. Overall I need much more tea than what I'm used to from other vendors to achieve a similar strength, no matter whether western style or gongfu.
Also, the (optical) leaf quality is nowhere near than what is suggested on the pictures. Leaves are all pretty broken, most teas contained signicifant amounts of tiny pieces. Three teas also contain significant amounts of sticks, one of them even seemed like it was intentionally filled with extra sticks, because the top of that bag contained way more sticks than leaves (that one was my favourite though, funnily enough).

Regarding brewing methods I tried western at 90° and 100° and both 2g and 3.5g per 300 mml for 3.5 minutes, and Gongfu with Scotts Parameters, at both 90° as suggested by him and boiling.
For western, boiling and 3.5g produce the best results for all teas, while the other parameters do not work at all. None of them manage to produce a second brew worth drinking.
All of them performed much better using Gongfu. Not with the 90° suggested by YS though, that did not work at all, boiling is consistently way better. Had to be very careful with brewing, they tend to get very bitter very fast.

Overall, while the teas are not bad, I feel like the value for the money is just not there at all, in stark contrast to what is suggested on this sub (in comparison to similar priced tea from european vendors, if you factor in import costs and shipping). Should you decide to buy there, don't get tempted to buy more just to make the import costs worth it like I did.

I started my tea journey maybe a year and a half ago. It started with me drinking some tea a relative brought as a gift from a place called Fort and Mason. I tried something called Queen's Blend and loved it! It was black tea, but different than the stuff we got in shops. Eventually the Queen's Blend tea bags were finished and I tried Smoky something. I think what I liked about that was that it was an usual taste, I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me, I think it was the first time I drank tea that felt ""sophisticated"". 

I looked up some tea sites (instead of picking up the usual stuff at the market), and noticed some weird names. Oolog? Puer? What's this? I *had* to know! My search led me to some Don Mei videos, firstly it was one where he described how different teas were made and what the differences were. I was confused and surprised how much information in this world of tea. I looked through his other videos where he tastes different teas and he gives his notes (I love his content!), and I decided I was ready to try some of these ""Chinese teas"". 

To be honest, I was completely ready to just find the whole thing exaggerated and a scam, but I was willing to take the chance and just quit if it wasn't to my liking. I tried to keep an open mind, and so I made my first order from YS, and picked a black tea, a green tea, an oolong, a white and a puer.

 

Wow. This thing was real! I remember the excitement I had, I really loved opening up a bag of tea and not knowing what to expect. I realized some stuff I liked and some stuff I didn't, but I thought it was such an interesting journey (my family wasn't as excited about the ""bad"" teas haha).

 

I've had a few orders since then, and I got pretty busy with work for a time when I noticed I wasn't drinking as much, and so this is what I wanted to share with this great community and see what I think. (here comes negative nancy)

 

1) Preparation; gong fu brewing was nice. Admittedly I *still* don't get everything right every brew, but I get by. I recently started just putting 6~7 grams of tea and fill the gaiwan (which might be 110 or 120ml? if not a bit more) just to make sure I don't get anything watery. However, I noticed sometimes I don't prepare any tea because it can be a real hassle and I'm just not in the mood for it. I know it's part of thee process or ritual, and it gets you the best bang for your buck, but when I'm tired I just want a pitcher ready to pour into my small tea cup with some almonds. I don't want to keep repeating it, but the hassle of the brewing process sometimes stops me. It's made worse by how every brew practically gives me two gulps of tea, so I'm left wanting more but I have to brew it. It's somewhat alleviated by my adjustments recently, and I guess I don't care if I'm spending too many tea leaves since I get what I want, but the issue is still there. One of the hassles I found is that I put *too* much tea, I end up throwing the leaves before spending them.


2) The second problem is the kind of teas. Drinking tea has definitely been an experience, but I noticed that *most* of the teas I had weren't that much to my liking. It feels like there are certain common notes in Chinese teas that I'm not big on. That's not really an issue, but it feels right now that I'm not as excited to explore teas. I love MLX, one of the Jinggus (I forgot which), Lapsang Souchong grew on me. I tried 2 puers and both were awful. I had pine needle the first time and it was great, but later orders were never as good. I loved TGY but lately they get astringent too quickly. It's probably my brewing. But all of these together has left me reluctant to explore teas like I used to, so that love of trying something new isn't there as much.


Like I said, a negative post. I still plan on ordering more teas (I'm out of mlx), but I thought with what I'm facing the only people who'll understand are the tea community. Thanks for reading.",I haven't been drinking as much tea (a bit of a negative post)

Nothing have dates on them and the one thing that does has 2015 stamped in it. Other boxes look old but are still unopened. At what point do you not give teas a try? Should I just throw them out? I normally drink Taiwan oolong and am guilty of drinking vacuum sealed tea from 2017.",How long before tea goes bad?
14780,tea,"I'm sure there's probably a lot of nuance I might be missing, but I have nice Chinese black tea. I put 5g into my kyusu (I can't find a gaiwan near me + kyusu seems to work just fine), and then measure 80ml of 90C water. Brew for 10 seconds + 5 for each brew. Repeat throughout the whole day (up to 10 or 15 times). Is this process okay? I find that even before work I don't find this to be that much work, just drink, pour, repeat.

It actually seems pretty convenient to do since once the water is done heating up, you can enjoy your tea very quick without steeping. I sort of had the impression it was much harder than it was.

I'm not really hardcore about this (yet?) and would rather not get too invested until I know what I like. I already have a sampler of Chinese greens on the way, so I think I am set there.

As far as I can tell, there aren't very many Japanese green tea samplers out there, so I made a $20 cart on Yunomi out a few 20g listings of Sencha, Gyokuro, Kukicha, Genmaicha, and Hojicha. I have literally never had any one of these before and have no idea if that's a good way of going about things.

I guess I also got concerned that nearly all the steeping guides are absent my casual basket infuser, particularly Gyokuro which I've read needs room for the leaves to breathe.

14801,tea,"Now that I have a nice, small but functional collection of different clay teapots for various ages and types of sheng, yancha, Dancong,  and red tea, I am finding that I brew a bit differently in a designated clay teapot versus a gaiwan.

Specifically, I am actually more careful when using a neutral gaiwan as this is what I do when first getting to know a tea. I tend to do a greater number of shorter steeps less than 10 seconds, and use more caution leaving the lid off between steeps. 

But once I feel I understand the nuances of a tea and switch over to using a clay pot, I tend to steep a bit longer (at least 10-15 seconds on first steep, most often 20+ seconds per steep after that) and leave the lid on between steeps. This can vary from tea to tea and pot to pot but I find that it's generally true when switching from using a gaiwan to a pot.

This was not necessarily a conscious strategy but upon thinking more about it, I find that the more casual style is generally more fun with a tea I know well, and I also enjoy very strong flavors in tea, so it makes sense why this method evolved for me. The clay usually helps balance any flaws or issues with doing longer steeps or exposing the tea to more heat. 

Also, most often if I'm sharing tea with someone new I'll use the gaiwan so we can discuss nuances and they smell aromas and see the leaves and tea liquid better as the process unfolds.

14879,tea,"Though this information is fairly irrelevant, I’d love to share why I love tea and the history thats turned me into a complete tea nerd. I read something on this Reddit a few hours ago, saying that tea is more than a drink it’s a memory and I’d like to expand on that idea. For me, tea is not just a single memory so much as it is my history. When I was about 4, I would stay up and have a cup of tea every night with my housekeeper Sandra. A simple cup of Lipton tea with sweetened condensed milk. I looked forward to those few minutes at night where I had a chance to watch her secret ritual of making tea and relaxing; I was so excited and so happy to invited into her nightly routine. For a few years I partook in this nightly tea time and started to feel as though a day hadn’t ended till I had my cup of tea. After few years passed, my teacher and mentor, Bozena, would make a cup of PG tips with a little splash of milk and a spoonful of sugar every morning. For Bozena, this drink was mundane, but to me it was a new potion I was dying to try. After my first sip I fell in love, my morning hadn’t begun till the first drops of builders tea touched my lips. I continued this morning and nightly ritual for about 10 years blissfully unaware of the unexplored world of tea waiting for me. I was 20 when I took a class in New York City; I got off the train In grand central looked up a place to get a cuppa. I found a Japanese tea house called ippodo. In that house, my eyes were opened. I learned of all the different Japanese green tea, first flushes, roasted teas and barley teas. I began collecting every type of tea I could find. I went to restaurants explicitly for their tea menus. At one of the these restaurants I found out about the diverse world of Darjeelings. I became obsessed. I needed new pots, Kyusu’s, pitchers, scales, whisks, filters. Just finding a beautiful tea wasn’t enough it had to be prepared perfectly to express itself correctly. I experimented with every tea I could find till I thought I couldn’t produce a finer liquor. I explored green, black white, yellow, and pu erh teas from all over the world. I finally bought a tea masterclass from rare tea company and learned about oolong... My final frontier. I’ve spent the past year finding every oolong I get my hands on, taking every class I can on Gong fu, got a gaiwan and have had a cup of oolong everyday since, and expect to continue till I can’t physically make tea anymore. I have a few cups a day and can’t think of a time I’m happier unless I with loved ones. Tea has not only marked the different epochs of my life but in someway has become my life. My fondest memories can be brought to the surface with just a whiff of my morning brew. I am so grateful for this wonderful drink and I am so grateful for the people who introduced me to the culture, expanded my knowledge of tea or simply just took the time to share a cup with me. Looking forward to many more cups and looking forward to hopefully introducing others to the wonderful world of tea.
